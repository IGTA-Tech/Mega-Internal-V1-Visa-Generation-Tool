# Field-Specific Guide: Arts & Entertainment (O-1B)

## Overview

This guide provides strategies for O-1B petitions in the arts, including visual arts, music, dance, theater, and other performing and creative arts. The O-1B standard of "distinction" (high level of achievement above that ordinarily encountered) is different from O-1A's "extraordinary ability" standard.

## Understanding the O-1B Standard

### "Distinction" vs. "Extraordinary Ability"

**O-1B Arts Standard:**
- High level of achievement
- Skill and recognition substantially above ordinarily encountered
- Does NOT require being at the "very top" of field
