- [ ] Check fork count matches claim
- [ ] Verify repository is public and accessible

**Patent Claims:**
- [ ] Verify patent number exists in USPTO database
- [ ] Confirm beneficiary is named inventor
- [ ] Check patent status (granted vs. pending)
- [ ] Verify patent dates are accurate

**Company/Product Claims:**
- [ ] Verify user counts from reliable sources (press releases, filings)
- [ ] Confirm revenue figures from verifiable sources
- [ ] Check company valuations from Crunchbase/PitchBook
- [ ] Verify job titles match LinkedIn/company records

**Conference/Award Claims:**
