## Verification and Anti-Hallucination Requirements

### CRITICAL: All Scientific Claims Must Be Verified

**Publication/Citation Claims:**
- [ ] Verify publication exists in PubMed/Web of Science
- [ ] Confirm citation counts from official sources
- [ ] Check h-index from Google Scholar or Web of Science
- [ ] Verify journal impact factors from official sources

**Grant Claims:**
- [ ] Verify grants from NIH RePORTER or NSF Award Search
- [ ] Confirm grant amounts and dates
- [ ] Check PI status on grants
- [ ] Verify funding agency is legitimate

**Award Claims:**
- [ ] Verify award from awarding organization
- [ ] Confirm year and selection criteria
- [ ] Check past recipient lists
- [ ] Verify media coverage

**Position/Affiliation Claims:**
- [ ] Verify position from institution
- [ ] Confirm department and title
- [ ] Check tenure status if claimed
- [ ] Verify lab size and composition

### Red Flags for Scientific Evidence

**Immediately Investigate:**
- Citation counts that seem unusually high
- Grants from unknown funding agencies
- Awards from unrecognizable organizations
- Publications in predatory journals
- Claims of impact without citations

**Never Include Without Verification:**
- Self-reported citation counts
- Publications in journals that cannot be verified
- Grants without official documentation
- Awards without official verification

### Official Verification Sources

| Evidence Type | Primary Source | Secondary Sources |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Publications | PubMed, Web of Science | Google Scholar, Scopus |
| Citations | Web of Science, Scopus | Google Scholar |
| Grants | NIH RePORTER, NSF | Foundation databases |
| Awards | Organization websites | Press coverage |
| H-index | Web of Science | Google Scholar |

### Predatory Journal Warning Signs

**Red Flags:**
- Journal not indexed in PubMed or Web of Science
- Extremely fast publication times (< 2 weeks)
- No rigorous peer review process
- Listed on Beall's List or similar
- Unsolicited email invitations to publish

**Action:** If journal is questionable, exclude from evidence or note concerns.
