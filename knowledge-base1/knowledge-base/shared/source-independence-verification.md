# Source Independence Verification Guide

**Purpose:** Ensure all evidence sources meet USCIS independence requirements to avoid RFE triggers and strengthen petition credibility.

---

## 1. Why Independence Matters to USCIS

### Regulatory Basis

**8 CFR 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B):**
Published material about the beneficiary must be from "professional or major trade publications or other major media."

**AAO Interpretation:**
- Sources must represent independent, third-party recognition
- Self-promotional materials are not persuasive
- Coordinated coverage raises credibility concerns
- Beneficiary-controlled sources carry minimal weight

### Common AAO Denial Language

> "The petitioner has not demonstrated that these articles represent independent third-party recognition of the beneficiary's achievements, as opposed to promotional material."

> "Evidence that appears to have been generated at the beneficiary's behest does not demonstrate the type of sustained acclaim contemplated by the regulations."

## 3. Media Conglomerate Analysis

**USCIS Concern:** Multiple articles from same media conglomerate may represent single editorial decision, not independent recognition.

**Example:**

- May count as fewer "independent" sources

### 3.2 Major Media Ownership Groups

- ABC News
- ESPN
- FiveThirtyEight
- The Undefeated

- National Geographic

**Warner Bros. Discovery:**

- TNT Sports

**Comcast/NBCUniversal:**

### 3.3 Conglomerate Tracking Protocol

**When collecting sources:**
1. Identify ultimate parent company
2. Track number of sources per conglomerate
3. Aim for max 25% from single conglomerate
4. Prioritize diversity across ownership groups

**Tracking Template:**
| Source | Publication | Parent Company | Independence Score |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| URL 1 | ESPN | Disney | Independent editorial |
| URL 2 | ABC News | Disney | Same conglomerate as ESPN |
| URL 3 | CNN | Warner | Independent |

## 4. Independence Verification Checklist

### 4.1 For Every Source

**Basic Verification:**
- [ ] Source is not owned/controlled by beneficiary
- [ ] Source is not employer of beneficiary
- [ ] Content is not from press release
- [ ] Article was not paid placement/sponsored
- [ ] Journalist has no disclosed relationship with beneficiary

**Editorial Independence:**
- [ ] Publication has independent editorial standards
- [ ] Article reflects original reporting (not just aggregation)
- [ ] Journalist's byline is verifiable
- [ ] Publication is not primarily promotional vehicle

**Third-Party Recognition:**
- [ ] Content is ABOUT beneficiary (not just mentions)
- [ ] Recognition is merit-based
- [ ] Selection was competitive (if applicable)
- [ ] Award/recognition has established criteria

### 4.2 Red Flags for Independence

**Immediately Investigate:**
| Red Flag | What It May Indicate |
|----------|---------------------|
| Article appears same day as press release | Recycled PR content |
| Language matches press release closely | Not independent journalism |
| Multiple articles from same week | Coordinated PR campaign |
| Author cannot be verified | Potential sponsored content |
| Publication accepts paid content | May be pay-to-play |
| Source is in beneficiary's home city only | Limited recognition scope |
| All coverage tied to single event | One-time attention, not sustained |

### 4.3 Deep Investigation Protocol

**When red flags appear:**

1. **Search for original reporting**
   - Does journalist's version add new information?
   - Are there quotes not in press release?
   - Is there independent verification of claims?

2. **Check publication standards**
   - What is publication's editorial policy?
   - Does it distinguish editorial from sponsored?
   - What is its reputation in the industry?

3. **Verify journalist credentials**
   - Is journalist staff or freelance?
   - What else have they written?
   - Any relationship with beneficiary's industry?

4. **Compare to press materials**
   - Is article substantially different from PR?
   - Are there facts not from beneficiary?
   - Does journalist take a position?

## 5. Expert Letter Independence

### 5.1 USCIS Scrutiny of Expert Letters

**Key Concern:** Letters from colleagues, employers, or business partners are inherently less persuasive than truly independent experts.

**AAO Language:**
> "Letters from colleagues and collaborators, while relevant, may be insufficient without evidence from independent, third-party sources confirming the beneficiary's standing in the field."

### 5.2 Expert Independence Spectrum

| Category | Independence Level | Persuasiveness |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Complete stranger in field | HIGHEST | Very Strong |
| Met at conference only | HIGH | Strong |
| Indirect professional connection | MODERATE | Good |
| Former colleague (2+ years ago) | MODERATE | Good |
| Current industry peer | LOW-MODERATE | Acceptable |
| Direct supervisor/employer | LOW | Weak alone |
| Business partner | LOW | Weak alone |
| Co-author | LOW | Weak alone |
| Subordinate | VERY LOW | Very Weak |
| Family member | NONE | Exclude |

### 5.3 Expert Letter Portfolio Strategy

**Optimal Mix (6-10 letters):**
- 30-40% truly independent experts (no relationship with beneficiary)
- 30-40% indirect relationship (same field, met occasionally)
- 20-30% direct knowledge (colleagues who can speak to specifics)

**Disclosure Protocol:**
- Always disclose expert's relationship with beneficiary
- Explain how expert knows beneficiary's work
- Demonstrate expert credentials independently

### 5.4 Expert Independence Documentation

**For each expert, document:**
```
EXPERT: [Name, Title, Institution]
CREDENTIALS: [Why qualified to opine]
RELATIONSHIP: [How knows beneficiary - be specific]
INDEPENDENCE LEVEL: [HIGH/MODERATE/LOW]
DISCLOSURE IN LETTER: [Yes/No - must be Yes]
CONTRIBUTION: [What unique perspective this expert adds]
```
