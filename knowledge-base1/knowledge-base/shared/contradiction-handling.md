# Contradiction Handling Methodology

**Purpose:** Systematic framework for identifying, analyzing, and resolving contradictions in evidence before they become RFE triggers.

---

## 1. Why Contradictions Matter

### USCIS Perspective

**Contradictions Are RFE Triggers:**
- Officers are trained to identify inconsistencies
- Contradictions undermine credibility of entire petition
- Even minor inconsistencies can cascade into denials
- AAO frequently cites contradictions in denial decisions

**Common AAO Language:**
> "The record contains conflicting information regarding [ISSUE]. When a petitioner provides inconsistent information, it calls into question the reliability of the evidence submitted."

## 2. Types of Contradictions

### 2.1 Statistical Contradictions

| Contradiction Type | Example | Risk Level |
|-------------------|---------|------------|
| Ranking discrepancies | "Ranked #5" vs "Top 10" | MODERATE |
| Date inconsistencies | "2019 award" vs "2020 ceremony" | HIGH |
| Count mismatches | "500 citations" vs "467 citations" | MODERATE |
| Score differences | "8.5 rating" vs "85% score" | LOW |
| Record conflicts | "25-3 record" vs "26-2 record" | HIGH |

### 2.2 Narrative Contradictions

| Contradiction Type | Example | Risk Level |
|-------------------|---------|------------|
| Role description changes | "CEO" vs "Founder & CEO" | LOW |
| Achievement characterization | "Won championship" vs "Championship finalist" | CRITICAL |
| Timeline conflicts | "Founded in 2015" vs "Started operations 2016" | MODERATE |
| Scope claims | "Global leader" vs regional coverage only | HIGH |
| Impact statements | "Transformed industry" vs modest evidence | HIGH |

### 2.3 Source Contradictions

| Contradiction Type | Example | Risk Level |
|-------------------|---------|------------|
| Source vs source | ESPN says X, BBC says Y | MODERATE |
| Source vs official record | Media claim vs federation record | HIGH |
| Expert vs documentation | Letter claims vs certificates show | CRITICAL |
| Older vs newer sources | 2020 article vs 2023 profile | MODERATE |

### 2.4 Document Contradictions

| Contradiction Type | Example | Risk Level |
|-------------------|---------|------------|
| Doc 1 vs Doc 5 | Different facts in analysis vs brief | CRITICAL |
| URL reference vs quote | URL says X, quoted as Y | CRITICAL |
| Expert letter vs evidence | Expert claims vs actual documentation | HIGH |
| Resume vs petition | CV dates vs petition dates | HIGH |

## 3. Contradiction Detection Framework

### 3.1 Pre-Filing Detection Protocol

**Step 1: Create Master Fact Sheet**

For every claim, document:
```
CLAIM: [Specific claim]
SOURCE 1: [URL/Document] - [What it says]
SOURCE 2: [URL/Document] - [What it says]
SOURCE 3: [URL/Document] - [What it says]
OFFICIAL: [Official record if applicable]
CONSISTENT: [YES/NO]
NOTES: [Any discrepancies]
```

**Step 2: Cross-Reference Critical Facts**

Mandatory cross-referencing for:
- [ ] Rankings (across all ranking sources)
- [ ] Win-loss records (official vs media)
- [ ] Award years (announcement vs ceremony)
- [ ] Position titles (across all documents)
- [ ] Company names (exact legal name)
- [ ] Dates of employment/achievements
- [ ] Statistical claims (citations, sales, revenue)

**Step 3: Document Consistency Check**

Before finalizing:
- [ ] Doc 1 facts match Doc 5 brief
- [ ] All URLs quoted accurately
- [ ] Expert letters match documented evidence
- [ ] Timeline is internally consistent
- [ ] Numbers/statistics are uniform

### 3.2 Common Detection Points

**Names:**
- Full legal name vs common name
- Name transliteration variations
- Maiden vs married name
- Professional vs legal name

**Dates:**
- Award announcement vs ceremony date
- Calendar year differences (fiscal vs calendar)
- Timezone confusion for international events
- Competition date vs results date

**Numbers:**
- Point-in-time statistics vs current
- Different calculation methodologies
- Rounding differences
- Currency conversion variations

## 4. Contradiction Resolution Framework

### 4.1 Resolution Hierarchy

**When sources conflict, prioritize:**

1. **Official Records** (highest authority)
   - Government databases
   - Federation/league records
   - Court filings
   - Corporate registrations

2. **Primary Sources**
   - Original certificates/documents
   - Direct quotes from beneficiary
   - Employer verification letters
   - Official announcements

3. **Tier 1 Media**
   - Major news outlets
   - Wire services (AP, Reuters)
   - Established publications

4. **Tier 2-3 Sources**
   - Industry publications
   - Regional media
   - Blog/unofficial sources

### 4.2 Resolution Strategies by Type

**For Statistical Contradictions:**

| Strategy | When to Use | How to Execute |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Use most authoritative source | Official record exists | Cite official record, note date |
| Use most recent data | Statistics change over time | Cite with "as of [DATE]" |
| Use most conservative figure | Cannot determine authority | Use lower/less favorable number |
| Explain methodology difference | Different calculation methods | Note in brief why numbers differ |

**For Narrative Contradictions:**

| Strategy | When to Use | How to Execute |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Use official title | Role descriptions vary | Cite employment verification |
| Clarify timeline | Events span multiple dates | Provide full timeline explanation |
| Address directly | Cannot reconcile | Acknowledge in brief with explanation |
| Exclude problematic source | Source is unreliable | Remove from evidence, use alternatives |

**For Source Contradictions:**

| Strategy | When to Use | How to Execute |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Prefer official over media | Federation vs ESPN | Use federation, cite media as supporting |
| Prefer older for historical facts | Reporting errors accumulate | Use contemporaneous sources |
| Prefer newer for current status | Status changes | Use most recent with date |
| Triangulate | 2+ sources agree vs 1 | Go with majority, note discrepancy |

### 4.3 Resolution Documentation

**For every resolved contradiction, document:**

```
CONTRADICTION: [What conflicted]
SOURCE A: [What it said] - [Authority level]
SOURCE B: [What it said] - [Authority level]
RESOLUTION: [What we're using]
RATIONALE: [Why this resolution is correct]
BRIEF TREATMENT: [How addressed in petition if needed]
```

## 5. When Contradictions Cannot Be Resolved

### 5.1 Exclusion Decision

**Exclude evidence if:**
- Contradiction is fundamental to claim
- Resolution would require speculation
- Source reliability cannot be established
- Contradiction could trigger deeper investigation

**Proceed with caution if:**
- Contradiction is minor/immaterial
- Clear explanation exists
- Official record supports one version
- Multiple other sources confirm one version

### 5.2 Acknowledgment Strategy

**When you must address contradiction in brief:**

```
Sample Language:

"While [SOURCE A] reported [CLAIM X] and [SOURCE B] reported [CLAIM Y],
the official records from [AUTHORITY] confirm [ACTUAL FACT]. This
discrepancy appears to result from [EXPLANATION - e.g., reporting
error, different measurement dates, etc.]."
```

**Never:**
- Ignore contradictions hoping officer won't notice
- Include contradictory evidence without explanation
- Misquote sources to eliminate contradiction
- Cherry-pick partial quotes to hide contradictions

## 8. Contradiction Severity Assessment

### 8.1 Severity Matrix

| Factor | Low Severity | Moderate Severity | High Severity | Critical |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| Materiality | Peripheral fact | Supporting detail | Key claim | Core qualification |
| Visibility | Requires detailed reading | Side-by-side comparison shows | Obvious on review | Immediately apparent |
| Resolution | Easy to explain | Requires some explanation | Difficult to explain | Cannot explain |
| Frequency | Single instance | Multiple instances | Pattern | Systematic |

### 8.2 Action by Severity

| Severity | Action |
|----------|--------|
| LOW | Note for record, no petition treatment needed |
| MODERATE | Resolve using hierarchy, brief mention if needed |
| HIGH | Must resolve authoritatively, may need exclusion |
| CRITICAL | Do not file until resolved; may require new evidence |

## 9. RFE Response for Contradictions

### 9.1 If RFE Identifies Contradiction

**Response Framework:**

1. **Acknowledge** the apparent discrepancy
2. **Explain** why discrepancy exists (if legitimate reason)
3. **Provide** authoritative documentation resolving it
4. **Demonstrate** which version is correct and why

**Sample Language:**
```
"USCIS has identified an apparent discrepancy between [SOURCE A]
reporting [CLAIM X] and [SOURCE B] reporting [CLAIM Y]. This
discrepancy is explained by [REASON]. The official record from
[AUTHORITY], enclosed as Exhibit [X], confirms that [ACTUAL FACT].
We have also included [ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE] corroborating this."
```

### 9.2 Documentation for RFE Response

**Must include:**
- Authoritative source resolving contradiction
- Explanation of why discrepancy occurred
- Additional corroborating evidence
- Clear statement of correct fact
