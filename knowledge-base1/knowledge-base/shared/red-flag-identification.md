**Purpose:** Proactively identify potential weaknesses before filing to prevent RFEs and denials.

## 1. Evidence Quality Red Flags

### 1.1 Source Tier Red Flags

| Red Flag | Severity | Action Required |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| More than 50% sources are Tier 3-4 | CRITICAL | Find more Tier 1-2 sources |
| Zero Tier 1 sources | CRITICAL | Search major media specifically |
| All sources from same parent company | HIGH | Verify independence |
| Most recent source > 2 years old | HIGH | Search for recent coverage |
| Only local/regional coverage | MODERATE | Expand search nationally |

### 1.2 Source Independence Red Flags

**CRITICAL:** USCIS scrutinizes whether evidence is truly independent.

| Red Flag | What It Indicates | Action |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| All sources from same media conglomerate | Coordinated coverage | Find diverse sources |
| Coverage matches press release language | Not independent journalism | Find original reporting |
| All coverage from same week | Likely single PR push | Find sustained coverage |
| Sources only cite each other | Echo chamber | Find primary sources |
| All expert letters from same organization | Lack of independence | Seek external experts |

### 1.3 Temporal Red Flags

| Red Flag | Severity | Interpretation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| All evidence from single year | HIGH | Lacks sustained acclaim |
| 3+ year gap in coverage | MODERATE | May indicate career pause |
| Most recognition > 5 years old | HIGH | May not demonstrate current standing |
| All awards from early career | MODERATE | Need to show continued recognition |
| No recent activity documented | HIGH | Questions current extraordinary ability |

## 2. Documentation Red Flags

**CRITICAL WARNING SIGNS:**

| Generic praise without specifics | Conclusory, not persuasive | Request specific examples |
| No comparison to field peers | Fails to establish "extraordinary" | Ask experts to compare |
| Missing expert credentials | Expert authority questionable | Document credentials thoroughly |
| Letter doesn't match expert's field | Expertise mismatch | Find appropriate experts |
| Copy/paste language across letters | Appears coordinated | Ensure each is unique |
| Expert has business relationship | Conflict of interest | Disclose or replace |

### 2.2 Award Documentation Red Flags

| Red Flag | Risk Level | Resolution |
|----------|------------|------------|
| Award from unknown organization | CRITICAL | Verify org legitimacy or exclude |

| Unable to verify selection criteria | HIGH | Contact awarding body |
| "Participation" vs. excellence award | MODERATE | Clarify competitive nature |
| Self-nominated award | MODERATE | Document external selection |
| Award given to all applicants | CRITICAL | Exclude from evidence |

### 2.3 Ranking Documentation Red Flags

| Red Flag | Issue | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
