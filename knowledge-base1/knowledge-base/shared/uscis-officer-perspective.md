# USCIS Officer Perspective Training

**Purpose:** Understand how USCIS adjudicators evaluate extraordinary ability petitions to create documents that align with their decision-making framework.

---

## 1. The Adjudicator's Mindset

### 1.1 Key Principles

**Officers Are Trained To:**
- Apply regulations consistently
- Review evidence skeptically but fairly
- Look for documentary corroboration
- Identify gaps and inconsistencies
- Make decisions based on preponderance of evidence

**Officers Are NOT:**
- Field experts in beneficiary's specialty
- Familiar with industry jargon
- Trying to deny petitions
- Making subjective judgments on talent
- Influenced by emotional appeals

### 1.2 Decision Framework

Officers apply a systematic approach:

1. **Initial Review** - Is petition complete and properly filed?
2. **Criteria Counting** - Does evidence meet 3+ criteria?
3. **Quality Assessment** - Is each criterion genuinely satisfied?
4. **Final Merits** - Does totality show extraordinary ability?
5. **Decision** - Approve, RFE, or Deny

## 2. What Officers Look For (by Criterion)

### 2.1 Awards Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Award from nationally/internationally recognized organization
- Clear documentation of selection criteria
- Evidence of competitiveness (nominee counts)
- Notable past recipients
- Media coverage of award

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- Unknown awarding organization
- No selection criteria documented
- Appears to be participation trophy
- Pay-to-play award
- Self-nomination without external selection

**Officer Questions:**
> "Is this award recognized nationally/internationally, or just within a small community?"
> "How many people competed for this award?"
> "What are the selection criteria?"

### 2.2 Membership Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Organization requires outstanding achievements for admission
- Peer nomination/review process documented
- Low acceptance rate (<10%, ideally <5%)
- Notable members
- Clear membership criteria

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- Anyone can join by paying dues
- No peer review of achievements
- New organization with no track record
- Membership criteria not documented
- Self-selection

**Officer Questions:**
> "What achievements are required for membership?"
> "Who judges whether applicants qualify?"
> "What percentage of applicants are accepted?"

### 2.3 Published Material Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Articles are primarily ABOUT the beneficiary
- Published in major/professional publications
- Third-party journalism (not PR)
- Multiple independent sources
- Focus on beneficiary's work in the field

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- Articles merely cite or quote beneficiary
- Press releases disguised as articles
- Coverage from beneficiary's own organization
- Only local/regional coverage
- All coverage from same time period (single PR push)

**Officer Questions:**
> "Is this article about the beneficiary or about something else?"
> "Is this independent journalism or promotional content?"
> "Is the publication major/professional?"

### 2.4 Judging Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Documentation of judging role
- Evidence of selective invitation
- Pattern of judging participation
- Distinguished organization/event being judged
- Independent verification

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- No documentation of judging
- Judging internal company matters only
- Cannot verify the event/organization
- Single informal judging instance
- Self-selected judging role

**Officer Questions:**
> "Did this person actually serve as a judge?"
> "Was the judging role competitive to obtain?"
> "What was being judged and by whom?"

### 2.5 Original Contributions Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Expert letters explaining significance
- Evidence of adoption by others
- Citations or references by field
- Documentation of impact
- Comparison to other contributions

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- Claim without third-party validation
- Only beneficiary claims significance
- No evidence of adoption/implementation
- Contribution is routine work
- No expert letters addressing significance

**Officer Questions:**
> "Is this contribution of major significance or routine work?"
> "Has anyone outside the beneficiary's organization adopted this?"
> "What do independent experts say about significance?"

### 2.6 Scholarly Articles Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Peer-reviewed publications
- Citations from others in field
- Publications in recognized journals
- Strong h-index for career stage
- Field-appropriate metrics

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- Predatory journal publications
- Zero citations despite years since publication
- Cannot verify peer review
- Self-published work
- Questionable journal legitimacy

**Officer Questions:**
> "Are these legitimate peer-reviewed publications?"
> "What is the impact of this scholarship?"
> "Is this authorship pattern normal for the field?"

### 2.7 Critical Role Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Distinguished reputation of organization documented
- Role was critical/essential to organization
- Impact during tenure quantified
- Letters from organizational leadership
- Clear role description

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- Organization's distinguished reputation not proven
- Role was not critical (just employed there)
- Cannot verify role or organization
- Brief tenure
- Inflated title claims

**Officer Questions:**
> "Is this organization truly distinguished?"
> "Was the beneficiary's role actually critical?"
> "What was the impact during tenure?"

### 2.8 High Salary Criterion

**Approval Indicators:**
- Salary comparison from authoritative sources
- Total compensation documented
- Clearly above industry norms
- Geographic adjustment considered
- Multiple data sources

**RFE/Denial Triggers:**
- Comparison to wrong peer group
- No authoritative salary data
- Base salary only (no total comp)
- One-time bonus counted as salary
- Cherry-picked comparison

**Officer Questions:**
> "Is this salary truly high compared to the correct peer group?"
> "Where does the comparison data come from?"
> "Is the comparison fair and accurate?"

## 3. Final Merits Evaluation

### 3.1 What Officers Assess

After confirming 3+ criteria met, officers evaluate:

1. **Sustained Acclaim** - Recognition over time, not one-time
2. **National/International Scope** - Beyond regional recognition
3. **Top of Field** - Among small percentage at very top
4. **Totality of Evidence** - How all pieces fit together

### 3.2 Common Final Merits Issues

| Issue | Officer Concern | How to Address |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| All evidence from 1-2 years | Not sustained | Show multi-year recognition |
| Only regional coverage | Not national | Find national sources |
| Meets criteria minimally | Not at very top | Strengthen evidence quality |
| Inconsistencies in record | Credibility question | Resolve contradictions |
| Evidence doesn't add up | Extraordinary claim unsupported | Ensure totality is cohesive |

### 3.3 Final Merits Approval Indicators

**Strong Cases Show:**
- Recognition spanning multiple years
- Multiple types of evidence reinforcing each other
- Comparative evidence showing top-tier standing
- National and international recognition
- Consistent narrative across all evidence

## 8. Writing for the Officer

### 8.1 Effective Legal Brief Style

**Do:**
- Use clear, professional language
- Cite to specific evidence
- Apply regulatory framework
- Address potential weaknesses
- Use comparative context

**Don't:**
- Use hyperbole or exaggeration
- Make unsupported claims
- Argue emotionally
- Bury important points
- Use jargon without explanation

### 8.2 Sample Officer-Oriented Language

**Instead of:**
> "The beneficiary is one of the greatest [professionals] in history."

**Write:**
> "The evidence demonstrates that the beneficiary is among the small percentage at the top of [field], as shown by [specific evidence]."

**Instead of:**
> "This award is obviously prestigious."

**Write:**
> "The [Award] is a nationally recognized prize for excellence in [field], as evidenced by [media coverage/past recipients/selection process]. See Exhibit X."

**Instead of:**
> "Everyone knows the beneficiary's contributions are significant."

**Write:**
> "The major significance of the beneficiary's contributions is demonstrated by [adoption evidence, expert letters, citations]. Six independent experts confirm that these contributions have transformed [specific aspect of field]. See Exhibits A-F."

## 9. Addressing Officer Concerns Preemptively

### 9.1 Anticipate Questions

For each piece of evidence, ask:
- What might an officer question about this?
- Is this claim adequately documented?
- Could this be seen as self-promotional?
- Is the source clearly independent?
- Are there any inconsistencies to address?

### 9.2 Address Weaknesses Directly

**If weakness exists:**
1. Acknowledge it briefly
2. Provide context/explanation
3. Offer mitigating evidence
4. Pivot to strengths

**Sample Language:**
> "While the beneficiary's [area] evidence is concentrated in [region], the record demonstrates national impact through [evidence]. Additionally, [expert] confirms that recognition in [region] carries national significance because [reason]."

## 10. Quick Reference: Officer Priorities

### 10.1 What Officers Care About Most

1. **Regulatory compliance** - Does evidence meet CFR requirements?
2. **Credibility** - Can claims be trusted and verified?
3. **Independence** - Is evidence from third parties?
4. **Documentation** - Is everything properly supported?
5. **Consistency** - Does everything fit together?

### 10.2 What Officers Care About Less

1. Quantity of evidence (quality matters more)
2. How long the brief is (clear and complete matters)
3. Emotional appeals (evidence matters)
4. Famous supporter names (unless relevant)
5. Future plans (current status matters)
