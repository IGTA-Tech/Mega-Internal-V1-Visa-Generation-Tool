# Request for Evidence (RFE) Response Guide

## Overview

A Request for Evidence (RFE) is issued by USCIS when additional documentation is needed to make a decision. RFEs are common for extraordinary ability petitions and should be treated as an opportunity to strengthen the case.

**Key Principle:** An RFE is not a denial. It is an invitation to provide additional evidence and clarification.
