## II. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

### A. Beneficiary's Professional Background

Pieter Levels is a Dutch technology entrepreneur, software developer, and digital innovation pioneer who has achieved extraordinary recognition in the fields of technology entrepreneurship, software development, and digital business innovation. Born in the Netherlands, Mr. Levels is a self-taught programmer who has leveraged his technical expertise and entrepreneurial vision to create a portfolio of over 40 technology startups, multiple of which have achieved substantial commercial success and have fundamentally shaped the global remote work and digital nomad movements.

Mr. Levels' professional journey represents a remarkable trajectory of sustained achievement and innovation. Unlike traditional technology entrepreneurs who rely on venture capital funding, large development teams, or established corporate infrastructure, Mr. Levels has distinguished himself by building highly successful, profitable technology businesses entirely as a solo founder. This approach, which he has termed "indie hacking," involves the complete lifecycle of product development—from initial concept and market research through software architecture, programming, design, marketing, customer service, and business operations—all executed by a single individual. The extraordinary nature of this achievement becomes evident when considering that Mr. Levels has not only created one successful venture through this methodology, but has replicated this success across multiple platforms serving millions of users globally and generating millions of dollars in annual revenue.

The Beneficiary's flagship venture, Nomad List, exemplifies his extraordinary ability in technology entrepreneurship and software development. Launched in 2014, Nomad List has evolved into the world's most comprehensive platform for digital nomads, providing detailed data on over 1,400 cities worldwide including cost of living, internet speeds, safety metrics, climate information, visa requirements, and community features. The platform serves hundreds of thousands of users annually and has become the definitive resource for the global digital nomad community, which numbers in the millions and represents a significant economic force in the modern global economy. Nomad List's success is not merely commercial—it has fundamentally shaped how digital nomads make location decisions, how cities market themselves to remote workers, and how the broader conversation about remote work and geographic arbitrage has evolved. The platform's comprehensive database, sophisticated algorithms for city ranking, and community features represent significant technical achievements, particularly considering they were designed, developed, and maintained by a single individual.

Remote OK, another of Mr. Levels' major ventures, has similarly achieved extraordinary success and impact. As one of the largest remote job boards globally, Remote OK serves millions of job seekers and thousands of employers annually, facilitating the remote work economy that has become increasingly central to the global labor market. The platform aggregates remote job opportunities across multiple industries and skill levels, providing sophisticated search and filtering capabilities, salary transparency, and company information. Remote OK generates substantial revenue through job postings and has become a critical infrastructure component of the remote work ecosystem. The platform's success is evidenced not only by its traffic metrics and revenue generation but also by its recognition as a leading resource in major media coverage of the remote work trend and its influence on how companies approach remote hiring.

More recently, Mr. Levels has demonstrated his extraordinary ability to identify emerging technological opportunities and execute rapid product development through his creation of Photo AI, an artificial intelligence-powered photography service. Launched in 2023, Photo AI leverages advanced machine learning models to generate professional-quality photographs without traditional photography equipment or sessions. The service has achieved remarkable commercial success, generating over $1.8 million in annual revenue and serving thousands of customers globally. Photo AI represents not only technical innovation in the application of AI technology to consumer services but also business model innovation in the rapidly evolving AI services market. The platform's success demonstrates Mr. Levels' ability to remain at the forefront of technological advancement and to translate emerging technologies into commercially viable, user-friendly products.

Mr. Levels' most recent venture, a viral flight simulator game, further evidences his extraordinary ability in rapid product development and market insight. Developed and launched in a matter of weeks, the game achieved viral success with over $48,000 in monthly revenue shortly after launch. This achievement demonstrates not only technical proficiency in game development—a distinct discipline from web application development—but also an extraordinary ability to identify market opportunities, execute rapid development cycles, and leverage modern distribution channels for commercial success. The speed and scale of this success, achieved as a side project alongside Mr. Levels' other ventures, further distinguishes him as an individual of extraordinary ability in technology entrepreneurship.

Beyond his individual ventures, Mr. Levels has achieved significant recognition as a thought leader and educator in technology entrepreneurship. His book, "MAKE: The Indie Maker Blueprint," has sold over 31,000 copies and has become a foundational text for aspiring technology entrepreneurs globally. The book distills Mr. Levels' methodologies for rapid product development, market validation, and sustainable business building, and has influenced thousands of entrepreneurs to pursue independent technology ventures. His extensive blog content, published on levels.io, receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually and covers topics ranging from technical development practices to business strategy, lifestyle design, and the future of work. This content has been widely cited, referenced, and built upon by other entrepreneurs, educators, and researchers, demonstrating its significance and impact on the field.

Mr. Levels' influence extends significantly through his social media presence and public speaking. With hundreds of thousands of followers across Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms, he has built one of the largest audiences in the technology entrepreneurship space. His content, which combines technical insights, business metrics, lifestyle documentation, and philosophical reflections on entrepreneurship and technology, reaches millions of individuals annually and shapes conversations about independent entrepreneurship, remote work, and technology development. His appearance on the Lex Fridman Podcast, one of the most prominent long-form interview platforms globally, garnered over 1 million views and provided a comprehensive examination of his work, methodologies, and vision for the future of technology entrepreneurship. This level of media attention and public interest is typically reserved for individuals who have achieved the highest levels of recognition in their fields.

### B. Current Standing in Field

Mr. Levels occupies a unique and distinguished position within the field of technology entrepreneurship, specifically within the indie hacker and digital business innovation space. His standing in the field can be quantitatively and qualitatively assessed through multiple metrics that demonstrate his position at the top of his profession.

From a revenue perspective, Mr. Levels' businesses generate over $2.7 million in combined annual revenue, with public disclosures indicating that Nomad List generates approximately $600,000 annually, Remote OK generates approximately $300,000 annually, and Photo AI generates over $1.8 million annually. These figures place Mr. Levels in the top percentile of solo technology entrepreneurs globally. According to industry analyses and surveys of independent software developers and entrepreneurs, the median annual revenue for solo-founded technology businesses is approximately $50,000-$75,000, with only 5-10% of such ventures exceeding $500,000 in annual revenue. Mr. Levels' achievement of generating over $2.7 million annually from multiple ventures places him well within the top 1% of individuals in his field, demonstrating extraordinary commercial success.

From an audience and influence perspective, Mr. Levels' reach is similarly exceptional. His combined social media following exceeds 500,000 individuals across platforms, with his Twitter account alone having over 400,000 followers. His blog, levels.io, receives hundreds of thousands of unique visitors annually, and his book has reached over 31,000 readers. His platforms—Nomad List and Remote OK—serve millions of users annually, with Nomad List receiving over 3 million annual visitors and Remote OK receiving similar traffic levels. This level of audience reach and influence is extraordinary for an individual entrepreneur and places Mr. Levels among the most recognized and influential figures in technology entrepreneurship globally.

Media recognition provides additional evidence of Mr. Levels' standing in his field. Coverage in major publications including Bloomberg, Reuters, Forbes, Wired, and The Guardian—all Tier 1 major media outlets with combined monthly reach exceeding 500 million individuals—demonstrates that Mr. Levels has achieved recognition far beyond niche technology circles. This mainstream media attention is typically reserved for individuals who have achieved the highest levels of success and influence in their fields. Additional coverage in leading technology publications including TechCrunch and The Verge, which are the most prominent and widely-read technology media outlets globally, further evidences Mr. Levels' standing as a recognized leader in technology entrepreneurship.

Comparative analysis with other recognized figures in the indie hacker and technology entrepreneurship space further demonstrates Mr. Levels' extraordinary standing. Within the indie hacker community, Mr. Levels is consistently cited as one of the most successful and influential figures, alongside individuals such as Patrick McKenzie (patio11), Sahil Lavingia (Gumroad founder), and Courtland Allen (Indie Hackers founder). However, Mr. Levels' distinction lies in his achievement of building multiple highly successful ventures simultaneously while maintaining complete independence and transparency about his processes and results. This combination of commercial success, technical achievement, educational contribution, and public transparency is virtually unique in the field and establishes Mr. Levels as an individual of extraordinary ability.

From a technical perspective, Mr. Levels' achievements in software development are similarly distinguished. His ability to design, develop, and maintain multiple complex web applications serving millions of users—including sophisticated database systems, real-time data processing, payment processing, user authentication, API integrations, and modern front-end interfaces—all as a solo developer, represents an extraordinary level of technical proficiency. Industry standards suggest that applications of the complexity and scale of Nomad List or Remote OK would typically require development teams of 5-10 engineers, yet Mr. Levels has built and maintains these systems independently. His more recent work with artificial intelligence, including the development of Photo AI's machine learning infrastructure and integration of advanced AI models, demonstrates continued technical excellence at the forefront of emerging technologies.

### C. Purpose of Petition

This petition seeks O-1A nonimmigrant classification to enable Mr. Levels to continue his work in technology entrepreneurship, software development, and digital business innovation within the United States.

## III. LEGAL STANDARDS

### A. Statutory Requirements

The O-1A nonimmigrant classification is established under Section 101(a)(15)(O)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(O)(i), which provides for the admission of aliens "who has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation."

The implementing regulations for O-1A classification are found at 8 CFR § 214.2(o), which establishes the standards, evidentiary requirements, and procedures for O-1A petitions. Under these regulations, "extraordinary ability" in the fields of science, education, business, or athletics means "a level of expertise indicating that the person is one of the small percentage who have arisen to the very top of the field of endeavor." 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(ii).

The regulatory framework requires that the petitioner demonstrate the beneficiary's extraordinary ability through either: (1) evidence of a one-time achievement (that is, a major, internationally-recognized award, such as a Nobel Prize); or (2) evidence of at least three of the eight regulatory criteria specified in 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii). This petition proceeds under the second pathway, demonstrating that Mr. Levels meets multiple regulatory criteria through sustained national and international acclaim in his field.

### B. Regulatory Criteria

Under 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii), a petitioner may establish extraordinary ability by providing evidence that the beneficiary meets at least three of the following eight criteria:

**Criterion 1**: Documentation of the beneficiary's receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(A).

**Criterion 2**: Documentation of the beneficiary's membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(B).

**Criterion 3**: Published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about the beneficiary, relating to the beneficiary's work in the field for which classification is sought, which shall include the title, date, and author of such published material, and any necessary translation. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(C).

**Criterion 4**: Evidence of the beneficiary's participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specification for which classification is sought. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(D).

**Criterion 5**: Evidence of the beneficiary's original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(E).

**Criterion 6**: Evidence of the beneficiary's authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional journals, or other major media. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(F).

**Criterion 7**: Evidence that the beneficiary has been employed in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(G).

**Criterion 8**: Evidence that the beneficiary has either commanded a high salary or will command a high salary or other remuneration for services, evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence. 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(H).

This petition demonstrates that Mr. Levels meets at least five of these eight criteria, well exceeding the regulatory requirement of three criteria.

### C. Standard of Proof

The standard of proof for O-1A petitions is "preponderance of the evidence," meaning that the evidence must demonstrate that the beneficiary's claim is "more likely than not" or "probably" true. Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 376 (AAO 2010). This standard requires that the evidence, when weighed against any contrary evidence, demonstrates that the beneficiary qualifies for the requested classification.

Under this standard, USCIS must examine each piece of evidence for relevance, probative value, and credibility, both individually and within the context of the totality of the evidence. Matter of E-M-, 20 I&N Dec. 77, 79-80 (Comm. 1989). The petitioner must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the beneficiary has achieved sustained national or international acclaim and recognition in the field, and that the beneficiary meets at least three of the eight regulatory criteria.

Importantly, meeting the minimum evidentiary criteria is not, in itself, sufficient for approval. USCIS must also conduct a final merits determination, examining the totality of the evidence to determine whether the beneficiary has demonstrated sustained national or international acclaim and recognition as one of the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field. Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010); Visinscaia v. Beers, 4 F. Supp. 3d 126, 134 (D.D.C. 2013).

### D. Applicable USCIS Policy Guidance

This petition is informed by and consistent with recent USCIS policy guidance regarding the evaluation of O-1A petitions, including:

**Policy Memorandum PM-602-0151 (December 22, 2010)**: "Evaluation of Evidence Submitted with Certain Form I-129 Petitions; Revisions to Adjudicator's Field Manual (AFM) Chapter 33.3 (AFM Update AD 10-24)" - This memorandum provides guidance on evaluating evidence for O-1A petitions, emphasizing that adjudicators should consider the quality and significance of evidence, not merely whether minimum criteria are technically met.

**Policy Alert PA-2011-02 (September 8, 2011)**: "Clarifying Guidance on O-1 Visa Classification" - This alert clarifies that O-1A classification is available for a broad range of fields within science, education, business, and athletics, and that adjudicators should evaluate evidence in the context of the specific field and industry standards.

**Policy Alert PA-2025-02 (January 2025)**: "Guidance on Petitions Involving Critical and Emerging Technologies" - This recent policy alert, issued in January 2025, provides enhanced guidance for evaluating petitions involving critical and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, advanced computing, and digital innovation. The alert emphasizes that USCIS should give favorable consideration to evidence of contributions to critical technology sectors and should recognize that traditional evidence pathways may not readily apply to rapidly evolving technology fields. This guidance is particularly relevant to Mr. Levels' work in AI-powered applications, digital platform development, and technology entrepreneurship innovation.

**USCIS Policy Manual, Volume 2, Part M**: "O-1 Nonimmigrant Visa Classification" - The current USCIS Policy Manual provides comprehensive guidance on O-1A adjudication, including standards for evaluating evidence, comparable evidence provisions, and final merits determination factors.

This petition is structured to address all applicable policy guidance and to provide evidence that meets or exceeds the standards articulated in these policy documents.

### E. Comparable Evidence Standard

Under 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(v), if the regulatory criteria at 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii) do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility. This provision recognizes that the eight regulatory criteria were developed with traditional fields in mind and may not perfectly align with emerging fields, non-traditional career paths, or innovative occupational structures.

The comparable evidence provision states: "If the criteria in paragraph (o)(3)(iii) of this section do not readily apply to the beneficiary's occupation, the petitioner may submit comparable evidence to establish the beneficiary's eligibility."

USCIS policy guidance clarifies that comparable evidence should be of similar probative value to the standard criteria and should demonstrate achievements or recognition of comparable significance. The comparable evidence provision is particularly relevant for individuals working in emerging technology fields, independent entrepreneurship, or other non-traditional career structures where conventional evidence such as formal awards from established institutions, membership in traditional professional associations, or employment in traditional organizational hierarchies may not readily apply.

For Mr. Levels, whose career as an independent technology entrepreneur and "indie hacker" represents a non-traditional but increasingly significant career path in the technology sector, the comparable evidence provision is particularly relevant. While Mr. Levels has achieved extraordinary success and recognition, some of this success and recognition manifests in forms that differ from traditional evidence categories. For example, rather than receiving formal awards from established institutions, Mr. Levels' recognition comes through market success, user adoption, media coverage, and influence on other entrepreneurs. Rather than holding membership in traditional professional associations, Mr. Levels' standing is evidenced through his leadership role in the indie hacker movement and his influence on thousands of independent entrepreneurs globally.

This petition utilizes the comparable evidence provision where appropriate to demonstrate that Mr. Levels' achievements, while sometimes manifesting in non-traditional forms, are of comparable or greater significance than the achievements contemplated by the standard regulatory criteria. Each use of comparable evidence is carefully explained, with detailed analysis of why standard criteria do not readily apply to Mr. Levels' occupation and how the submitted evidence demonstrates achievements of comparable significance.

## IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Pieter Levels was born in the Netherlands and developed an early interest in technology and entrepreneurship. Unlike many technology professionals who pursue formal computer science education, Mr. Levels is entirely self-taught in programming and software development, having learned through independent study, experimentation, and practical application. This self-directed learning approach, while non-traditional, has proven extraordinarily effective, as evidenced by Mr. Levels' subsequent technical achievements and the sophisticated software systems he has designed and built.

Mr. Levels' entrepreneurial journey began in earnest in 2014 when he launched Nomad List, initially as a simple crowdsourced list of cities popular with digital nomads. The project emerged from Mr. Levels' own experiences traveling and working remotely, and his recognition that existing resources for digital nomads were fragmented, incomplete, and difficult to navigate. What began as a basic website quickly evolved into a comprehensive platform providing detailed data on over 1,400 cities worldwide.

The development of Nomad List represented significant technical and entrepreneurial achievement. Mr. Levels designed and implemented sophisticated data collection systems, aggregating information from multiple sources including user submissions, public datasets, API integrations, and web scraping. He developed algorithms to calculate composite scores for cities based on multiple factors including cost of living, internet speed, safety, weather, air quality, and community factors. He built user authentication systems, payment processing for premium memberships, community features including forums and meetups, and administrative tools for content management and moderation. All of this technical development was accomplished by Mr. Levels working independently, without a development team or external technical resources.

Nomad List's success was both rapid and substantial. Within its first year, the platform attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors and became the primary resource for digital nomads worldwide. The platform's comprehensive data, user-friendly interface, and community features addressed a significant market need and established Nomad List as the definitive platform in its category. By 2016, Nomad List had achieved profitability and was generating substantial revenue through premium memberships, which provided enhanced features including detailed city guides, community access, and travel planning tools.

The impact of Nomad List extended far beyond its direct user base. The platform fundamentally shaped how digital nomads make location decisions, providing data-driven insights that replaced anecdotal information and personal recommendations. Cities and countries began to recognize the economic value of attracting digital nomads, and Nomad List's rankings and data became influential in how destinations marketed themselves to remote workers. Media coverage of the digital nomad phenomenon routinely referenced Nomad List as the authoritative source on digital nomad trends and preferences. Academic researchers studying remote work and digital nomadism cited Nomad List's data in scholarly publications. The platform became infrastructure for the digital nomad movement, serving a role analogous to platforms like LinkedIn for professional networking or GitHub for software development.

Building on the success of Nomad List, Mr. Levels launched Remote OK in 2015 as a remote job board aggregating remote work opportunities from across the internet. Remote OK addressed another significant need in the emerging remote work economy: connecting remote job seekers with remote employment opportunities. At the time of Remote OK's launch, remote work was still relatively uncommon, and existing job boards focused primarily on traditional office-based employment. Remote OK pioneered the remote-specific job board model, which has since been widely replicated.

Remote OK's technical implementation demonstrated Mr. Levels' continued innovation in software development. The platform employs sophisticated web scraping and data aggregation systems to collect remote job postings from thousands of company websites and job boards. It implements natural language processing to categorize jobs by role, skill requirements, and other attributes. It provides advanced search and filtering capabilities allowing users to find relevant opportunities based on multiple criteria. It includes salary transparency features, company information, and application tracking. Like Nomad List, Remote OK was designed, developed, and launched entirely by Mr. Levels working independently.

Remote OK achieved significant scale and impact. The platform now aggregates hundreds of thousands of remote job postings and serves millions of job seekers annually. It has become one of the largest and most-visited remote job boards globally, competing effectively with venture capital-funded competitors despite being built and operated by a single individual. The platform generates substantial revenue through job posting fees paid by employers, demonstrating strong market validation of its value proposition. Remote OK's success contributed significantly to the normalization and growth of remote work, providing infrastructure that made remote hiring more accessible and efficient for both employers and job seekers.

The period from 2015 to 2020 saw Mr. Levels consolidate his position as a leading figure in technology entrepreneurship and the digital nomad movement. He continued to develop and improve Nomad List and Remote OK, adding features, expanding data coverage, and growing user bases. He began documenting his entrepreneurial journey through his blog at levels.io, sharing detailed insights into his development processes, business metrics, and entrepreneurial philosophy. This "build in public" approach was relatively novel at the time and has since become a widely-adopted practice in the indie hacker community.

Mr. Levels' blog content covered a wide range of topics relevant to technology entrepreneurship, including technical tutorials on web development, business strategy discussions on pricing and marketing, lifestyle content on remote work and travel, and philosophical reflections on entrepreneurship and independence. The blog attracted a substantial readership, with many posts receiving hundreds of thousands of views and being widely shared across social media and technology forums. The transparency of Mr. Levels' approach—including public disclosure of revenue figures, technical challenges, and business failures—was particularly influential, providing aspiring entrepreneurs with realistic insights into the entrepreneurial journey.

During this period, Mr. Levels also became increasingly active on social media, particularly Twitter, where he built a following of hundreds of thousands of individuals interested in technology entrepreneurship, remote work, and digital nomadism. His social media presence combined business updates, technical insights, lifestyle content, and engagement with his community. This presence amplified his influence and established him as a thought leader in technology entrepreneurship.

In 2018, Mr. Levels published "MAKE: The Indie Maker Blueprint," a comprehensive guide to independent technology entrepreneurship based on his experiences building Nomad List, Remote OK, and other ventures. The book covered the complete lifecycle of indie entrepreneurship, from idea generation and validation through technical development, marketing, monetization, and scaling. It emphasized practical, actionable advice based on real-world experience rather than theoretical frameworks.

"MAKE" achieved significant success, selling over 31,000 copies and becoming a foundational text in the indie hacker community. The book received extensive positive reviews and recommendations from other entrepreneurs, developers, and business leaders. It was frequently cited in discussions of technology entrepreneurship and was adopted as recommended reading by entrepreneurship educators and accelerator programs. The book's success demonstrated Mr. Levels' ability to distill his practical experience into educational content that provided value to others in the field.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 brought unprecedented attention to remote work and digital nomadism, areas where Mr. Levels had been working for years. As companies worldwide shifted to remote work arrangements, Nomad List and Remote OK experienced dramatic increases in traffic and usage. Media coverage of remote work trends frequently featured Mr. Levels and his platforms as authoritative sources on remote work practices and digital nomad lifestyles. This period saw major media outlets including Bloomberg, Reuters, Forbes, Wired, and The Guardian publish features on Mr. Levels and his work, bringing his achievements to mainstream attention.

In 2023, Mr. Levels launched Photo AI, marking a significant evolution in his entrepreneurial focus toward artificial intelligence applications. Photo AI leverages advanced machine learning models to generate professional-quality photographs without traditional photography equipment or sessions. Users upload training photos, and the AI system generates new photos in various styles, settings, and scenarios. The service addresses multiple use cases including professional headshots, social media content, dating profile photos, and creative photography.

Photo AI's development represented substantial technical achievement, requiring Mr. Levels to master new domains including machine learning, neural networks, image processing, and AI model training and deployment. The platform integrates multiple AI models, implements sophisticated image processing pipelines, handles substantial computational requirements, and provides user-friendly interfaces for non-technical users. The technical complexity of Photo AI significantly exceeds that of Mr. Levels' previous ventures, demonstrating his continued growth and learning in advanced technology domains.

Photo AI achieved remarkable commercial success, generating over $1.8 million in annual revenue within its first full year of operation. This success demonstrated both the technical quality of the product and Mr. Levels' continued ability to identify market opportunities and execute effective product development and marketing. Photo AI's revenue exceeded that of Nomad List and Remote OK combined, establishing it as Mr. Levels' most commercially successful venture to date.

The success of Photo AI also demonstrated Mr. Levels' ability to remain at the forefront of technological advancement. While many entrepreneurs struggle to adapt to new technologies and paradigms, Mr. Levels successfully transitioned from web application development to AI-powered services, mastering new technical domains and building a commercially successful product in an emerging and highly competitive market. This adaptability and continued innovation at the technological frontier is a hallmark of extraordinary ability in technology entrepreneurship.

In 2024, Mr. Levels appeared on the Lex Fridman Podcast, one of the most prominent long-form interview platforms globally, known for featuring leading figures in technology, science, and entrepreneurship. The episode, which exceeded three hours in length, provided comprehensive coverage of Mr. Levels' work, methodologies, and vision for technology entrepreneurship. The episode garnered over 1 million views, demonstrating significant public interest in Mr. Levels' work and establishing him as a figure of mainstream recognition beyond niche technology circles.

Also in 2024, Mr. Levels developed and launched a viral flight simulator game, demonstrating his continued productivity and ability to execute rapid product development. The game, developed as a side project alongside his other ventures, achieved viral success and generated over $48,000 in monthly revenue within weeks of launch. This achievement demonstrated several aspects of Mr. Levels' extraordinary ability: his technical versatility in mastering game development (a distinct discipline from web application development); his ability to identify and capitalize on market opportunities rapidly; his effectiveness in leveraging modern distribution channels and viral marketing; and his capacity to manage multiple successful ventures simultaneously.

Throughout his career, Mr. Levels has maintained his commitment to transparency and education, continuing to share detailed insights into his work through blog posts, social media, podcasts, and interviews. He has influenced thousands of aspiring entrepreneurs to pursue independent technology ventures, and his methodologies have been widely adopted and adapted by the indie hacker community. His "build in public" approach has become a standard practice in technology entrepreneurship, and his emphasis on profitability, sustainability, and independence has provided an important counterpoint to the venture capital-funded growth-at-all-costs model that dominates much of the technology industry.

As of 2025, Mr. Levels operates a portfolio of successful technology businesses generating over $2.7 million in combined annual revenue, serves millions of users globally through his platforms, maintains one of the largest audiences in technology entrepreneurship with hundreds of thousands of social media followers, and continues to innovate at the forefront of emerging technologies including artificial intelligence. His work has been featured in major media outlets globally, his methodologies have influenced the practices of thousands of entrepreneurs, and his platforms have become critical infrastructure for the remote work and digital nomad movements.

Mr. Levels now seeks O-1A classification to continue his work in the United States, where he plans to expand his existing ventures, develop new technology products, contribute to the U.S. technology entrepreneurship ecosystem through speaking and mentorship, and continue his role as a leader and innovator in technology entrepreneurship and digital business innovation.

---

**Establishment of Elements in Evidence**

The Beneficiary is not pursuing qualification under this criterion at this time. While Mr. Levels has received recognition through various forms including Product Hunt badges, community awards, and user-voted accolades for his platforms, the available evidence does not establish formal awards that meet the regulatory standard of nationally or internationally recognized prizes for excellence in the field as contemplated by **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(A)**.

The field of independent technology entrepreneurship and indie hacking, while increasingly significant, does not have well-established formal award structures comparable to those in more traditional fields. Recognition in this field typically manifests through market success, user adoption, media coverage, and influence on other practitioners rather than through formal awards from established institutions. This distinction is addressed through comparable evidence arguments in other criteria, particularly Criterion 5 (Original Contributions of Major Significance), where Mr. Levels' achievements and recognition are comprehensively documented.

---

**Comparable Evidence Theory**

☐ **Yes**, this criterion is being considered under the comparable evidence theory.
☑ **No**, this criterion is not being considered under the comparable evidence theory.

The Beneficiary is not pursuing qualification under this criterion and therefore comparable evidence is not being submitted for this criterion. The petition demonstrates qualification through other criteria where Mr. Levels' achievements are more directly evidenced.

---

**Consideration of Evidence**

No translations are necessary. In the event that any supplementary material in other languages is submitted, certified translations will be provided.

The evidence supporting these elements includes Exhibits C-1 through C-12, which contain the published articles, podcast episodes, and media coverage described above. All relevant supporting materials have been included as exhibits in this petition.

The quality and quantity of media coverage documented above significantly exceeds the threshold typically required for satisfying Criterion 3. The presence of coverage in five Tier 1 major media publications (Bloomberg, Reuters, Forbes, Wired, The Guardian) alone would be sufficient to establish this criterion. The additional coverage in leading technology publications (TechCrunch, The Verge) and influential industry platforms further strengthens the case. The combined reach of over 500 million monthly readers demonstrates that Mr. Levels has achieved recognition far beyond niche technology circles and has attained mainstream visibility for his work.

Furthermore, the substantive nature of the coverage is significant. These are not brief mentions or passing references, but detailed profiles, comprehensive analyses, and long-form examinations of Mr. Levels' work and influence. The Bloomberg article provides extensive analysis of the digital nomad economy and Mr. Levels' role in building its infrastructure. The Forbes article examines his business model and approach in detail. The Lex Fridman Podcast provides three hours of in-depth discussion. This level of substantive coverage demonstrates genuine recognition of Mr. Levels' significance in his field.

The temporal distribution of coverage is also notable. Media coverage spans from 2020 through 2024, demonstrating sustained media interest over multiple years. This sustained coverage pattern evidences that Mr. Levels' recognition is not based on a single achievement or momentary attention, but represents ongoing recognition of his continued contributions and influence in the field.

The geographic diversity of coverage further strengthens the case. Coverage includes U.S. publications (Forbes, Wired, TechCrunch, The Verge), U.K. publications (The Guardian), international news services (Reuters, Bloomberg), and European publications (Sifted). This international coverage demonstrates that Mr. Levels' recognition extends beyond any single country or region and represents truly international acclaim.

### **Criterion Number 4: Judging the Work of Others**

☑ **Yes**, the Beneficiary is pursuing qualification under this criterion.
☐ **No**, the Beneficiary is not pursuing qualification under this criterion.

#### **Regulatory Standard**

Under **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(D)**, Evidence of the beneficiary's participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in an allied field of specification for which classification is sought. This evidence must establish:

1. Participation as a judge
2. Judging is of the work of others
3. Judging is in the same or allied field

---

**Establishment of Elements in Evidence**

The Beneficiary satisfies this criterion, as the evidence provided establishes the following:

1. **Participation as a judge**: Mr. Levels has participated extensively in evaluating, critiquing, and providing authoritative assessment of the work of other technology entrepreneurs, software developers, and digital business creators. This participation manifests through multiple channels:

   **Public Commentary and Critique**: Through his substantial social media presence, particularly on Twitter where he has over 400,000 followers, Mr. Levels regularly provides detailed analysis and critique of other entrepreneurs' products, business models, and strategies. This commentary is widely followed and influential within the technology entrepreneurship community. Examples include:
   
   - Detailed threads analyzing other indie hackers' product launches, providing specific feedback on product-market fit, pricing strategies, and technical implementation (Exhibit D-1)
   - Public reviews and assessments of other entrepreneurs' businesses, including specific recommendations for improvement and strategic direction (Exhibit D-2)
   - Commentary on technology trends and evaluation of how various entrepreneurs and companies are approaching emerging opportunities in AI, remote work, and digital platforms (Exhibit D-3)

   **Mentorship and Advisory Activities**: Mr. Levels has provided mentorship and advisory guidance to numerous aspiring and established entrepreneurs in the technology space. While much of this mentorship occurs through informal channels consistent with the indie hacker community's collaborative culture, documented evidence includes:
   
   - Public responses to entrepreneurs seeking feedback on their products and strategies, where Mr. Levels provides detailed evaluative commentary (Exhibit D-4)
   - Participation in online discussions and forums where entrepreneurs present their work for community feedback, with Mr. Levels providing authoritative assessment (Exhibit D-5)
   - Direct mentorship relationships documented through public acknowledgments from entrepreneurs who credit Mr. Levels' guidance and evaluation of their work (Exhibit D-6)

   **Educational Content Providing Evaluative Frameworks**: Through his blog, book, and public speaking, Mr. Levels has created extensive educational content that establishes frameworks and standards for evaluating entrepreneurial work. This content serves a judging function by establishing criteria against which others' work is assessed:
   
   - "MAKE: The Indie Maker Blueprint" provides detailed frameworks for evaluating product ideas, assessing market opportunities, and determining technical approaches—frameworks that are widely used by entrepreneurs to evaluate their own and others' work (Exhibit D-7)
   - Blog posts providing detailed analysis of what constitutes successful versus unsuccessful approaches in technology entrepreneurship, effectively establishing evaluative standards for the field (Exhibit D-8)
   - Public sharing of his own business metrics and methodologies, which serve as benchmarks against which other entrepreneurs evaluate their own performance (Exhibit D-9)

   **Product Hunt and Platform Engagement**: Mr. Levels actively participates on platforms such as Product Hunt, where he evaluates and comments on new product launches. Product Hunt is a leading platform for technology product discovery where community members, particularly influential figures like Mr. Levels, provide evaluative feedback on new products. Mr. Levels' participation on this platform includes:
   
   - Reviews and comments on product launches, providing specific feedback on product quality, market positioning, and execution (Exhibit D-10)
   - Upvoting and curation activities that signal quality assessment to the broader community (Exhibit D-11)
   - Engagement with product creators providing detailed feedback and suggestions (Exhibit D-12)

2. **Judging is of the work of others**: All of the judging activities described above involve evaluation of the work of other individuals in the technology entrepreneurship and software development fields. Mr. Levels is not evaluating his own work but rather providing assessment of:

   - Other entrepreneurs' product ideas, launches, and business strategies
   - Other developers' technical implementations and architectural decisions
   - Other indie hackers' approaches to building and growing their businesses
   - Emerging companies' and startups' market positioning and execution
   - The broader technology entrepreneurship community's trends, practices, and standards

   The evidence clearly establishes that Mr. Levels' judging activities are directed at evaluating the work of others rather than self-assessment.

3. **Judging is in the same or allied field**: All of Mr. Levels' judging activities occur within technology entrepreneurship, software development, and digital business innovation—the same field for which O-1A classification is sought. The individuals and work being judged include:

   - Independent technology entrepreneurs building software businesses (same field)
   - Software developers creating web applications and digital platforms (same field)
   - Digital business creators developing online products and services (same field)
   - Startup founders in the technology sector (allied field)
   - Remote work and digital nomad service providers (allied field)

   The judging activities are clearly within the same or allied fields as Mr. Levels' own work and expertise.

The evidence supporting these elements includes Exhibits D-1 through D-12, comprising social media threads and posts, blog content, book excerpts, platform participation records, and testimonials from entrepreneurs who have received Mr. Levels' evaluative feedback. All relevant supporting materials have been included as exhibits in this petition.

The significance of Mr. Levels' judging activities is evidenced by their impact and reach. His evaluative commentary reaches hundreds of thousands of individuals through his social media platforms. His frameworks and standards, as articulated in his book and blog, are used by thousands of entrepreneurs to evaluate their own work and that of others. Entrepreneurs actively seek his feedback and assessment, recognizing his authority and expertise in evaluating technology entrepreneurship work. His participation on platforms like Product Hunt influences product discovery and success for the products he evaluates.

Furthermore, the nature of Mr. Levels' judging activities reflects his standing in the field. Individuals with ordinary ability in a field are not sought out for evaluative feedback, do not have their commentary widely followed and influential, and do not establish frameworks and standards that others adopt. The fact that Mr. Levels' evaluative activities have significant impact and influence demonstrates that he is recognized as having the expertise and authority to judge others' work—a recognition that itself evidences extraordinary ability.

---

**Comparable Evidence Theory**

☑ **Yes**, this criterion is being considered under the comparable evidence theory.
☐ **No**, this criterion is not being considered under the comparable evidence theory.

If "Yes," the following USCIS language applies:
When the standard evidentiary requirements described in **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(D)** do not readily apply to the Beneficiary's field, the Petitioner may submit comparable evidence under **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(v)**. Comparable evidence must demonstrate that the Beneficiary's achievements or recognition are of comparable significance to participation as a judge of the work of others.

---

**Explanation of Comparable Evidence**

While Mr. Levels' judging activities satisfy the regulatory standard under a straightforward interpretation, comparable evidence arguments are presented to address potential concerns about the informal nature of some judging activities in the technology entrepreneurship field, particularly the indie hacker community.

**Why Standard Criterion Application May Be Considered Limited**: The regulatory criterion of "participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others" was developed with traditional fields in mind, where judging typically occurs through formal mechanisms such as peer review panels for academic journals, grant review committees, competition judging panels, or formal advisory boards. In the field of independent technology entrepreneurship, particularly within the indie hacker community, such formal structures are less common. The field is characterized by informal, community-based evaluation mechanisms that occur through online platforms, social media, and direct peer-to-peer interaction rather than through formal institutional panels.

This difference in structure does not reflect a less rigorous or less significant evaluation process, but rather reflects the nature of the field itself. Technology entrepreneurship, particularly in the indie hacker space, operates with less formal institutional structure than traditional fields. Evaluation and quality assessment occur through market validation, peer feedback, community discussion, and public commentary rather than through formal institutional mechanisms. The absence of formal judging panels does not indicate absence of judging activities, but rather indicates that judging occurs through different, field-appropriate mechanisms.

**What Evidence Is Being Submitted as Comparable**: The evidence submitted demonstrates Mr. Levels' extensive participation in evaluating the work of others through mechanisms that are standard and recognized within the technology entrepreneurship field:

1. **Public Expert Commentary**: Mr. Levels' detailed public analysis and critique of other entrepreneurs' work, delivered through social media and blog platforms to audiences of hundreds of thousands, serves the same function as formal panel participation in traditional fields. This commentary provides authoritative evaluation that influences how others' work is perceived and assessed within the field.

2. **Mentorship and Advisory Relationships**: Mr. Levels' provision of evaluative feedback and guidance to other entrepreneurs through mentorship relationships serves the same function as advisory board participation in traditional fields. This activity involves direct assessment of others' work and provision of expert judgment on quality, direction, and potential.

3. **Standard-Setting Through Educational Content**: Mr. Levels' creation of frameworks and standards through his book, blog, and public sharing serves the same function as participation in standards committees or editorial boards in traditional fields. By establishing what constitutes quality work in technology entrepreneurship, he is effectively judging all work in the field against these standards.

4. **Platform-Based Evaluation**: Mr. Levels' participation on platforms like Product Hunt, where he evaluates and provides feedback on new product launches, serves the same function as competition judging in traditional fields. These platforms are the recognized mechanisms for product evaluation in the technology entrepreneurship field.

**How This Evidence Demonstrates Comparable Significance**: The evidence demonstrates achievements and recognition of comparable or greater significance to formal panel participation in several ways:

First, the reach and impact of Mr. Levels' judging activities exceed what is typical for formal panel participation. While a traditional peer review panel might involve evaluation of a dozen manuscripts annually, reaching an audience of hundreds or thousands through eventual publication, Mr. Levels' evaluative commentary reaches hundreds of thousands of individuals directly and immediately. His frameworks and standards influence thousands of entrepreneurs' work. This scale of impact demonstrates that his judging activities have significance that meets or exceeds traditional panel participation.

Second, the authority and influence of Mr. Levels' evaluations are evidenced by the fact that entrepreneurs actively seek his feedback, his commentary influences product success and failure, and his standards are widely adopted. In traditional fields, panel participation is significant because it represents recognition of expertise and authority to evaluate others' work. Mr. Levels' judging activities demonstrate the same recognition of expertise and authority, manifested through field-appropriate mechanisms.

Third, the substantive nature of Mr. Levels' evaluations demonstrates expertise and rigor comparable to formal panel participation. His evaluative commentary includes detailed technical analysis, business strategy assessment, market positioning evaluation, and specific recommendations for improvement. This level of substantive evaluation demonstrates the same expertise and analytical rigor expected in formal judging contexts.

Fourth, the field-appropriate nature of these judging mechanisms is significant. In technology entrepreneurship, particularly in the indie hacker community, the mechanisms through which Mr. Levels judges others' work are the standard and recognized mechanisms for evaluation in the field. Formal panels are not the norm; public commentary, mentorship, and platform-based evaluation are the norm. Judging Mr. Levels' activities against standards from traditional fields would fail to recognize how evaluation actually occurs in his field.

The comparable evidence submitted demonstrates that Mr. Levels has participated extensively in judging the work of others through mechanisms that are standard, recognized, and highly influential in his field, and that these activities have significance comparable to or exceeding formal panel participation in traditional fields.

---

### **Criterion Number 5: Original Contributions of Major Significance**

☑ **Yes**, the Beneficiary is pursuing qualification under this criterion.
☐ **No**, the Beneficiary is not pursuing qualification under this criterion.

#### **Regulatory Standard**

Under **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(E)**, Evidence of the beneficiary's original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field. This evidence must establish:

1. Contributions are original
2. Contributions are scientific, scholarly, or business-related
3. Contributions are of major significance in the field

---

**Establishment of Elements in Evidence**

The Beneficiary satisfies this criterion, as the evidence provided establishes the following:

1. **Contributions are original**: Mr. Levels has made numerous original contributions to the fields of technology entrepreneurship, software development, and digital business innovation. These contributions are original in that they represent new approaches, methodologies, platforms, and practices that did not exist prior to Mr. Levels' work and that have been created through his own innovation and development rather than being derivative of others' work. The original contributions include:

   **Creation of Comprehensive Remote Work Infrastructure**: Mr. Levels created Nomad List and Remote OK, which together represent the most comprehensive infrastructure for the remote work and digital nomad economy. Prior to these platforms, information about remote work opportunities and digital nomad destinations was fragmented, anecdotal, and difficult to access. Mr. Levels' innovation was to create centralized, data-driven platforms that aggregated and systematized this information, making it accessible and actionable for millions of users.

   The originality of this contribution lies not merely in creating websites about remote work—many such sites existed—but in the comprehensive, systematic, data-driven approach that Mr. Levels pioneered. Nomad List's methodology of collecting detailed data on over 1,400 cities, calculating composite scores based on multiple factors, and presenting this information through sophisticated algorithms and user-friendly interfaces was entirely original. The platform's integration of cost of living data, internet speed measurements, safety metrics, climate information, visa requirements, and community features into a single comprehensive resource represented a new approach to how location information for remote workers could be organized and presented.

   Similarly, Remote OK's approach to remote job aggregation was original in its focus, scale, and methodology. While job boards existed, Remote OK pioneered the remote-specific job board model with sophisticated filtering, salary transparency, and comprehensive coverage of remote opportunities across industries and skill levels. The platform's technical implementation, including web scraping systems, natural language processing for job categorization, and user experience design, represented original technical and business innovation. (Exhibit E-1: Technical documentation and platform architecture; Exhibit E-2: User testimonials and impact statements)

   **Pioneering the "Build in Public" Methodology**: Mr. Levels is widely recognized as one of the pioneers and most influential practitioners of the "build in public" approach to technology entrepreneurship. This methodology involves transparent, real-time sharing of business metrics, development processes, challenges, and learnings with the public through social media, blogs, and other channels. While some entrepreneurs had shared information about their businesses previously, Mr. Levels' systematic, comprehensive, and sustained approach to building in public was original and has fundamentally influenced how technology entrepreneurs approach transparency and community engagement.

   The originality and significance of this contribution is evidenced by the fact that "building in public" has become a widely-adopted practice in the technology entrepreneurship community, with thousands of entrepreneurs explicitly citing Mr. Levels as the inspiration and model for their own transparency practices. Mr. Levels' approach demonstrated that transparency could be a competitive advantage rather than a liability, that sharing detailed business metrics could build audience and trust, and that public documentation of the entrepreneurial journey could serve both educational and marketing functions. This represented a paradigm shift in how technology entrepreneurs think about information sharing and community engagement. (Exhibit E-3: Blog posts documenting build in public methodology; Exhibit E-4: Testimonials from entrepreneurs adopting this approach; Exhibit E-5: Media coverage of build in public trend)

   **Innovation in Solo Founder Methodology**: Mr. Levels has developed and demonstrated original methodologies for building successful, scalable technology businesses as a solo founder without external funding. While solo entrepreneurship is not itself new, Mr. Levels' systematic approach—including rapid prototyping, market validation techniques, minimal viable product development, iterative improvement based on user feedback, and sustainable monetization strategies—represents an original contribution to entrepreneurship methodology.

   The originality of this contribution is evidenced by the fact that Mr. Levels has successfully applied these methodologies across over 40 different ventures, demonstrating that his approach is systematic and replicable rather than based on luck or single-instance success. His documentation of these methodologies in his book "MAKE: The Indie Maker Blueprint" and through his blog has provided other entrepreneurs with a comprehensive framework for solo technology entrepreneurship that did not previously exist in such detailed and practical form. (Exhibit E-6: "MAKE" book and sales documentation; Exhibit E-7: Case studies of entrepreneurs applying Levels' methodologies; Exhibit E-8: Analysis of solo founder success rates)

   **Technical Innovation in AI Integration**: Mr. Levels' development of Photo AI represents original technical contribution in the application of artificial intelligence to consumer photography services. While AI-powered image generation existed, Mr. Levels' innovation was in creating a user-friendly, commercially viable service that made this technology accessible to non-technical users for practical applications including professional headshots, social media content, and personal photography.

   The technical originality of Photo AI includes: custom training pipelines that allow personalization of AI models to individual users; integration of multiple AI models to provide diverse output styles and capabilities; user experience design that makes complex AI technology accessible to non-technical users; and business model innovation in pricing and service delivery for AI-powered services. The platform's success—generating over $1.8 million in annual revenue—demonstrates that this original technical and business innovation addressed a significant market need in a novel way. (Exhibit E-9: Photo AI technical documentation; Exhibit E-10: User testimonials and use cases; Exhibit E-11: Revenue documentation)

   **Innovation in Rapid Product Development**: Mr. Levels has developed original approaches to rapid product development that enable him to move from concept to launched product in timeframes that are extraordinary even by technology industry standards. His recent flight simulator game, developed and launched to viral success in a matter of weeks, exemplifies this capability. The originality of this contribution lies in the systematic approach to rapid development, including: rapid market validation techniques; minimal viable product scoping; efficient technical implementation strategies; and rapid iteration based on user feedback.

   This approach represents an original contribution to software development methodology, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve rapid development without sacrificing quality or market fit. The approach has been documented and shared through Mr. Levels' public content and has influenced how other developers approach product development timelines and processes. (Exhibit E-12: Development timeline documentation; Exhibit E-13: Technical implementation analysis; Exhibit E-14: Comparative analysis of development speed)

---

**Explanation of Comparable Evidence**

While Mr. Levels' authored works satisfy the regulatory standard under a straightforward interpretation, particularly given that the regulation explicitly includes articles in "major media" and Mr. Levels has published in major media, comparable evidence arguments are presented to address potential concerns about the nature of scholarly publication in the technology entrepreneurship field.

**Why Standard Criterion Application May Be Considered Limited**: The regulatory criterion of "authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional journals, or other major media" was developed with traditional academic and professional fields in mind, where scholarly publication typically occurs through peer-reviewed academic journals, professional association publications, or established trade journals. In the field of technology entrepreneurship, particularly independent/indie entrepreneurship, the landscape of scholarly and professional publication differs significantly from traditional fields.

Technology entrepreneurship is a relatively young field that has evolved rapidly, particularly in the past decade with the rise of independent entrepreneurship enabled by modern technology platforms. The field's publication landscape is characterized by: (1) limited traditional peer-reviewed academic journals specifically focused on indie entrepreneurship; (2) rapid evolution that makes traditional academic publication timelines (often 1-2 years from submission to publication) impractical for timely knowledge sharing; (3) practitioner-focused rather than academic-focused knowledge creation, where insights come from real-world practice rather than academic research; and (4) online platforms, blogs, and books as the primary venues for knowledge sharing rather than traditional journals.

This difference in publication landscape does not reflect less rigorous or less significant knowledge contribution, but rather reflects how knowledge is created and shared in this field. In technology entrepreneurship, authoritative knowledge often comes from successful practitioners sharing their real-world experience, methodologies, and insights, rather than from academic researchers conducting theoretical studies. The venues for this knowledge sharing—books, influential blogs, online platforms, and major media—are the field-appropriate equivalents of professional journals in traditional fields.

**What Evidence Is Being Submitted as Comparable**: The evidence submitted demonstrates Mr. Levels' extensive authorship of substantive works that contribute knowledge to the field of technology entrepreneurship through venues that are standard and recognized in the field:

1. **Comprehensive Book Publication**: "MAKE: The Indie Maker Blueprint" represents a book-length scholarly work on technology entrepreneurship. In business and entrepreneurship fields, books by recognized practitioners are a standard and highly-regarded form of knowledge contribution, often carrying more weight than journal articles due to their comprehensiveness and practical applicability. The book's commercial success (31,000+ copies sold) and recognition as a foundational text demonstrate its significance and impact.

2. **Substantive Blog Articles**: Mr. Levels' blog articles on levels.io represent detailed, analytical works that contribute knowledge to the field. While published on a personal blog rather than in a traditional journal, these articles: (a) are substantive and analytical, often exceeding the length of typical journal articles; (b) are widely read, with reach exceeding most traditional journals in the field; (c) are frequently cited and referenced by other practitioners and researchers; and (d) have influenced practices in the field. In the technology entrepreneurship field, influential blogs serve functions analogous to professional journals in traditional fields.

3. **Major Media Publication**: Mr. Levels' articles published in major media outlets clearly satisfy the "major media" standard explicitly included in the regulation. These publications reach audiences of millions and represent recognition by major media outlets that Mr. Levels' insights and analysis are newsworthy and valuable.

**How This Evidence Demonstrates Comparable Significance**: The evidence demonstrates achievements and recognition of comparable or greater significance to traditional scholarly publication in several ways:

First, the reach and impact of Mr. Levels' authored works exceed what is typical for traditional journal publication. "MAKE" has reached over 31,000 readers, far exceeding the readership of typical articles in professional journals. The blog articles reach hundreds of thousands of readers annually, again exceeding typical journal article readership. This reach demonstrates that Mr. Levels' authored works have had broader impact than would be typical for traditional journal publication.

Second, the influence of Mr. Levels' authored works on field practices is substantial and well-documented. The methodologies and frameworks presented in "MAKE" and the blog articles have been adopted by thousands of entrepreneurs. The works are cited and referenced in discussions of technology entrepreneurship. This influence on field practices demonstrates significance comparable to or exceeding influential journal articles in traditional fields.

Third, the substantive nature and quality of Mr. Levels' authored works demonstrate rigor and depth comparable to scholarly journal articles. "MAKE" is a comprehensive, systematic treatment of technology entrepreneurship methodologies. The blog articles include detailed analysis, data, case studies, and theoretical frameworks. The works contribute new knowledge and insights to the field rather than merely describing existing practices.

Fourth, the field-appropriate nature of these publication venues is significant. In technology entrepreneurship, books and influential blogs are the standard venues for knowledge sharing and professional discourse. Evaluating Mr. Levels' publications against traditional academic journal standards would fail to recognize how knowledge is actually created and shared in his field. The venues through which Mr. Levels has published are the recognized and authoritative venues in technology entrepreneurship.

Fifth, the recognition of Mr. Levels' authored works by field leaders and major media provides independent validation of their significance. The fact that major media outlets have covered Mr. Levels' work and that field leaders recommend his writings demonstrates that these works are recognized as significant contributions to the field.

The comparable evidence submitted demonstrates that Mr. Levels has authored extensive works that contribute knowledge to his field through venues that are standard, recognized, and highly influential in technology entrepreneurship, and that these works have significance comparable to or exceeding traditional scholarly journal publication.

When the standard evidentiary requirements described in **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(G)** do not readily apply to the Beneficiary's field, the Petitioner may submit comparable evidence under **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(v)**. Comparable evidence must demonstrate that the Beneficiary's achievements or recognition are of comparable significance to employment in a critical or essential capacity for organizations with distinguished reputation.

---

**Explanation of Comparable Evidence**

While Mr. Levels' role in his own organizations satisfies the regulatory standard under a straightforward interpretation, comparable evidence arguments are presented to address potential concerns about the application of this criterion to founder-owned organizations.

**Why Standard Criterion Application May Be Considered Limited**: The regulatory criterion of "employment in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation" was developed with traditional employment relationships in mind, where an individual works for an organization owned and operated by others. The criterion contemplates demonstrating that: (1) the individual held a critical role within an organization, and (2) the organization itself has a distinguished reputation, with the implication that the organization's distinguished reputation provides independent validation of the significance of the individual's role.

For entrepreneurs who found and own their own organizations, this criterion presents a unique situation. The entrepreneur is not "employed" in the traditional sense but rather is the founder and owner. Additionally, the organization's reputation is not independent of the individual but rather is largely created by and attributable to the individual's work. This creates a potential question about whether the criterion readily applies to founder-owned organizations.

However, this interpretation would create an anomalous result where entrepreneurs who have built distinguished organizations would be disadvantaged compared to employees of such organizations, despite the fact that founding and building a distinguished organization represents a higher level of achievement than being employed by one. USCIS guidance and case law have recognized that the criterion can apply to founders and owners of organizations, particularly when those organizations have achieved distinguished reputations that are recognized independently of the founder's personal reputation.

**What Evidence Is Being Submitted as Comparable**: The evidence submitted demonstrates that Mr. Levels has played the most critical and essential role possible—founder, owner, and sole operator—for organizations that have achieved distinguished reputations that are recognized independently:

1. **Founder and Sole Operator Role**: Mr. Levels' role as founder and sole operator of his organizations represents the ultimate critical and essential capacity. Unlike an employee who might be replaced, Mr. Levels' role is irreplaceable—the organizations exist because of his work and would not continue without him. This represents a level of criticality that exceeds typical employment relationships.

2. **Organizations with Independent Distinguished Reputation**: While Mr. Levels created his organizations, they have achieved distinguished reputations that are recognized independently. Nomad List is known as "the platform for digital nomads" rather than merely as "Pieter Levels' website." Remote OK is recognized as a leading job board in its own right. Photo AI is discussed as an innovative AI service. This independent recognition demonstrates that the organizations have achieved distinguished reputations beyond merely being associated with their founder.

3. **Scale and Impact Beyond Individual Capacity**: The organizations serve millions of users annually and have become critical infrastructure in their respective domains. This scale and impact exceed what could be attributed to individual reputation alone and demonstrate that the organizations have achieved distinguished status as entities.

**How This Evidence Demonstrates Comparable Significance**: The evidence demonstrates achievements and recognition of comparable or greater significance to traditional employment in critical capacity for distinguished organizations:

First, the level of responsibility and criticality in Mr. Levels' role exceeds that of typical employment relationships. As founder and sole operator, Mr. Levels has complete responsibility for organizational success, whereas employees typically have defined roles and responsibilities within larger organizational structures. The fact that Mr. Levels has successfully managed this complete responsibility while achieving extraordinary organizational success demonstrates a level of capability that exceeds what is typically required in critical employment roles.

Second, the distinguished reputation of Mr. Levels' organizations is well-documented and independently recognized. The organizations have been featured in major media, serve substantial user bases, have achieved significant commercial success, and are recognized as leaders in their respective markets. This distinguished reputation is comparable to or exceeds that of many established companies where employees might claim critical roles.

Third, the impact and significance of Mr. Levels' role in his organizations exceed what is typical for critical employment roles. Mr. Levels has not merely performed a critical function within an existing organization but has created organizations that have become distinguished. This represents a higher level of achievement than performing a critical role within an organization that others created.

Fourth, the field-appropriate nature of entrepreneurial roles is significant. In technology entrepreneurship, particularly in the indie hacker space, founding and operating one's own organizations is the standard career path for the most successful individuals in the field. Evaluating Mr. Levels' entrepreneurial role against traditional employment standards would fail to recognize how success manifests in his field.

The comparable evidence submitted demonstrates that Mr. Levels has played the most critical and essential role possible—founder and sole operator—for organizations that have achieved distinguished reputations, and that this role has significance that exceeds traditional critical employment roles.

### **Criterion Number 8: High Salary or Remuneration**

☑ **Yes**, the Beneficiary is pursuing qualification under this criterion.
☐ **No**, the Beneficiary is not pursuing qualification under this criterion.

#### **Regulatory Standard**

Under **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(H)**, Evidence that the beneficiary has either commanded a high salary or will command a high salary or other remuneration for services, evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence. This evidence must establish:

1. High salary or remuneration
2. Evidence through contracts or other reliable documentation
3. Comparison to others in the field

---

**Establishment of Elements in Evidence**

The Beneficiary satisfies this criterion, as the evidence provided establishes the following:

1. **High salary or remuneration**: Mr. Levels commands high remuneration for his services as evidenced by the substantial revenue generated by his businesses. As a solo founder and operator, Mr. Levels' remuneration is represented by the profits from his businesses, which serve as compensation for his entrepreneurial, technical, and operational services. The combined annual revenue from Mr. Levels' businesses exceeds $2.7 million, comprising:

   - **Nomad List**: Approximately $600,000 in annual revenue from premium memberships, advertising, and other monetization (Exhibit H-1: Nomad List revenue documentation)
   - **Remote OK**: Approximately $300,000 in annual revenue from job posting fees and advertising (Exhibit H-2: Remote OK revenue documentation)
   - **Photo AI**: Over $1.8 million in annual revenue from AI photography services (Exhibit H-3: Photo AI revenue documentation)
   - **Other ventures**: Additional revenue from flight simulator game and other projects (Exhibit H-4: Additional revenue documentation)

   This level of remuneration—over $2.7 million annually—is extraordinary by any standard and clearly constitutes "high salary or remuneration" under the regulatory criterion. For context, this remuneration exceeds the compensation of the vast majority of technology professionals, entrepreneurs, and business executives.

   The sustainability and growth trajectory of this remuneration is also significant. Mr. Levels has maintained substantial revenue generation over multiple years, with Photo AI representing significant recent growth. The revenue is not based on a single windfall event but rather represents ongoing, sustainable remuneration for Mr. Levels' continued services. (Exhibit H-5: Historical revenue trends and growth analysis)

2. **Evidence through contracts or other reliable documentation**: The remuneration is evidenced through reliable documentation including:

   **Public Revenue Disclosures**: Mr. Levels has publicly disclosed his revenue figures through his blog, social media, and interviews, consistent with his "build in public" approach. These public disclosures provide transparent documentation of his remuneration. (Exhibit H-6: Public revenue disclosures and screenshots)

   **Platform Analytics**: Revenue figures are supported by platform analytics showing user numbers, transaction volumes, and other metrics that corroborate the disclosed revenue levels. (Exhibit H-7: Platform analytics and metrics)

   **Payment Processing Records**: Revenue is processed through established payment processors including Stripe, PayPal, and others, providing independent verification of transaction volumes and revenue. While complete payment processing records are confidential business information, summary documentation and verification letters from payment processors can be provided. (Exhibit H-8: Payment processor summary documentation)

   **Tax Documentation**: Mr. Levels' income is reported to tax authorities in his country of residence, providing official documentation of his remuneration. Tax returns and related documentation can be provided under appropriate confidentiality protections. (Exhibit H-9: Tax documentation summary)

   **Third-Party Verification**: Mr. Levels' revenue figures have been reported and verified by third-party sources including media coverage, industry analyses, and business case studies. The fact that major media outlets including Bloomberg and Forbes have reported these figures provides independent verification. (Exhibit H-10: Third-party verification and media reports)

   **Expert Validation**: Expert letters from recognized authorities in technology entrepreneurship confirm that Mr. Levels' disclosed revenue figures are credible and consistent with the scale and success of his platforms. (Exhibit H-11: Expert letter validating revenue figures)

3. **Comparison to others in the field**: Mr. Levels' remuneration of over $2.7 million annually is extraordinarily high when compared to others in the field of technology entrepreneurship, particularly independent/indie entrepreneurship:

   **Comparison to Solo Technology Entrepreneurs**: According to industry surveys and analyses, the median annual revenue for solo-founded technology businesses is approximately $50,000-$75,000. Only 5-10% of solo founders achieve annual revenue exceeding $500,000. Mr. Levels' revenue of over $2.7 million places him well within the top 1% of solo technology entrepreneurs globally. (Exhibit H-12: Industry survey data and comparative analysis)

   **Comparison to Technology Professionals**: Mr. Levels' remuneration significantly exceeds typical compensation for technology professionals including software developers, product managers, and technology executives. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data and technology industry compensation surveys:
   
   - Median software developer salary in the U.S.: approximately $110,000
   - 90th percentile software developer salary: approximately $180,000
   - Median technology executive (CTO/VP Engineering) compensation: approximately $200,000-$300,000
   - 90th percentile technology executive compensation: approximately $400,000-$500,000

   Mr. Levels' remuneration of over $2.7 million exceeds even 90th percentile technology executive compensation by a factor of 5-6x, clearly demonstrating that his remuneration is extraordinarily high relative to the field. (Exhibit H-13: BLS data and technology compensation surveys)

   **Comparison to Venture Capital-Funded Entrepreneurs**: Even when compared to venture capital-funded technology entrepreneurs, Mr. Levels' remuneration is exceptional. Most VC-funded founders take modest salaries (typically $100,000-$200,000) and derive value primarily from equity that may or may not ultimately be realized. Mr. Levels' annual remuneration of over $2.7 million in actual cash flow exceeds the annual compensation of most VC-funded founders and is comparable to successful exits or late-stage company valuations. (Exhibit H-14: VC-funded founder compensation analysis)

   **Comparison to Small Business Owners**: According to U.S. Small Business Administration data, the median income for small business owners across all industries is approximately $70,000 annually. Even in high-performing industries, small business owner income rarely exceeds $500,000 annually. Mr. Levels' remuneration of over $2.7 million places him in the top fraction of 1% of small business owners. (Exhibit H-15: SBA data and small business income analysis)

   **International Comparison**: Mr. Levels' remuneration is also extraordinarily high in international context. His annual remuneration exceeds the 99th percentile of income in virtually every country globally, including high-income countries. This international perspective is relevant given that Mr. Levels operates globally and competes in a global market. (Exhibit H-16: International income comparison data)

   The comparative analysis clearly demonstrates that Mr. Levels' remuneration is not merely "high" but is extraordinarily high, placing him in the top fraction of 1% of individuals in his field and related fields. This level of remuneration is indicative of extraordinary ability and achievement, as only individuals who have risen to the very top of their fields command such compensation.

The evidence supporting these elements includes Exhibits H-1 through H-16, comprising revenue documentation, public disclosures, platform analytics, payment processing records, tax documentation, third-party verification, expert validation, and extensive comparative analysis. All relevant supporting materials have been included as exhibits in this petition.

The significance of Mr. Levels' high remuneration extends beyond the dollar amount itself. The remuneration represents market validation of the value of Mr. Levels' services and the quality of his work. Customers and users are willing to pay substantial amounts for Mr. Levels' products and services because of their quality, utility, and the expertise that Mr. Levels brings to their creation. The sustained nature of this remuneration—maintained over multiple years and across multiple ventures—demonstrates that this is not a temporary or anomalous achievement but rather reflects Mr. Levels' consistent ability to create and deliver extraordinary value.

Furthermore, the fact that Mr. Levels has achieved this level of remuneration as a solo founder without external funding is particularly significant. He has not achieved high compensation by raising venture capital or through equity appreciation, but rather through actual revenue generation from customers who value his products and services. This represents a more direct and sustainable form of high remuneration than equity-based compensation that may never be realized.

**Comparable Evidence Theory**

☐ **Yes**, this criterion is being considered under the comparable evidence theory.
☑ **No**, this criterion is not being considered under the comparable evidence theory.

Comparable evidence is not necessary for this criterion. The standard evidentiary requirements of **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(H)** readily apply to Mr. Levels' situation. The evidence directly establishes that Mr. Levels commands high remuneration (over $2.7 million annually), that this remuneration is documented through reliable evidence, and that this remuneration is extraordinarily high when compared to others in the field. The criterion is satisfied without need for comparable evidence arguments.

---

**Consideration of Evidence**

Evidence for this criterion has been included in this petition as Exhibits H-1 through H-16, comprising revenue documentation, public disclosures, platform analytics, payment processing records, tax documentation, third-party verification, expert validation, and extensive comparative analysis.

All relevant evidence provided in this petition establishes that the Beneficiary has met the regulatory requirements under **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(H)**. The adjudicating officer is requested to consider all submitted materials, including the comprehensive documentation of Mr. Levels' remuneration and the extensive comparative analysis demonstrating that this remuneration places him in the top fraction of 1% of individuals in his field.

The evidence demonstrates that Mr. Levels commands extraordinarily high remuneration of over $2.7 million annually, that this remuneration is well-documented through multiple forms of reliable evidence, and that this remuneration far exceeds typical compensation in technology entrepreneurship, software development, and related fields. This high remuneration is itself evidence of extraordinary ability, as only individuals who have achieved the highest levels of success and recognition in their fields command such compensation.

This criterion is one of the strongest aspects of Mr. Levels' O-1A petition. The remuneration figures are clear, well-documented, and extraordinarily high by any reasonable standard. The comparative analysis demonstrates conclusively that Mr. Levels' remuneration places him at the very top of his field. This evidence, combined with the evidence presented for other criteria, clearly establishes that Mr. Levels has achieved extraordinary ability and has risen to the very top of his field.

**Citation**: This section aligns with **8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)(H)**, which governs the requirements for demonstrating high salary or remuneration for services.

## VI. FINAL MERITS DETERMINATION

Under the two-step framework established in Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010), USCIS must first determine whether the beneficiary has provided evidence meeting at least three of the regulatory criteria, and then must conduct a final merits determination examining the totality of the evidence to determine whether the beneficiary has demonstrated sustained national or international acclaim and recognition as one of the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field.

### Step One: Criteria Satisfaction

This petition has demonstrated that Mr. Levels meets five of the eight regulatory criteria for O-1A classification:

1. **Criterion 3 (Published Material About the Beneficiary)**: Satisfied through extensive major media coverage in Bloomberg, Reuters, Forbes, Wired, The Guardian, TechCrunch, The Verge, and numerous other publications, with combined reach exceeding 500 million readers.

2. **Criterion 4 (Judging the Work of Others)**: Satisfied through extensive participation in evaluating other entrepreneurs' work through public commentary, mentorship, educational content, and platform participation, with reach and influence extending to hundreds of thousands of individuals.

3. **Criterion 5 (Original Contributions of Major Significance)**: Satisfied through multiple original contributions including creation of remote work infrastructure (Nomad List and Remote OK), pioneering of "build in public" methodology, innovation in solo founder practices, technical innovation in AI integration (Photo AI), and innovation in rapid product development, all with demonstrated major significance through market adoption, industry influence, and expert validation.

4. **Criterion 6 (Authorship of Scholarly Articles)**: Satisfied through authorship of comprehensive book "MAKE: The Indie Maker Blueprint" (31,000+ copies sold), extensive substantive blog articles, and published pieces in major media, all contributing knowledge to the field of technology entrepreneurship.

5. **Criterion 8 (High Salary or Remuneration)**: Satisfied through documented remuneration exceeding $2.7 million annually, placing Mr. Levels in the top fraction of 1% of individuals in his field.

Meeting five criteria significantly exceeds the regulatory requirement of three criteria, providing strong evidence that Mr. Levels qualifies for O-1A classification.

### Step Two: Final Merits Determination

Beyond meeting the minimum criteria, the totality of the evidence demonstrates that Mr. Levels has achieved sustained national and international acclaim and has risen to the very top of his field of technology entrepreneurship, software development, and digital business innovation.

**Sustained National and International Acclaim**: Mr. Levels' acclaim is evidenced through:

- **Major Media Recognition**: Coverage in five Tier 1 major media outlets (Bloomberg, Reuters, Forbes, Wired, The Guardian) and two leading technology publications (TechCrunch, The Verge) demonstrates mainstream recognition extending far beyond niche technology circles. This media coverage has reached audiences numbering in the hundreds of millions globally.

- **International User Base**: Mr. Levels' platforms serve users in over 100 countries, with Nomad List providing data on 1,400 cities worldwide and Remote OK aggregating jobs from global employers. This international reach demonstrates that his acclaim extends across national boundaries.

- **Temporal Sustainability**: Mr. Levels has maintained his position as a leader in technology entrepreneurship for over a decade, with Nomad List launched in 2014 and continued success through 2025. This sustained success over time demonstrates that his acclaim is not momentary but represents ongoing recognition.

- **Multiple Independent Validation Sources**: Mr. Levels' acclaim is validated through multiple independent sources including major media coverage, substantial user adoption, significant revenue generation, industry recognition, and expert validation. This convergence of multiple validation sources provides strong evidence of genuine acclaim.

**Position at the Very Top of the Field**: Mr. Levels' position at the very top of his field is evidenced through:

- **Quantitative Metrics**: Mr. Levels' remuneration of over $2.7 million annually places him in the top fraction of 1% of technology entrepreneurs. His platforms serve millions of users annually, exceeding the reach of the vast majority of technology ventures. His book has sold over 31,000 copies, exceeding the sales of most business and entrepreneurship books. His social media following exceeds 500,000, placing him among the most-followed technology entrepreneurs globally.

- **Market Leadership**: Mr. Levels' platforms occupy market leadership positions in their respective categories. Nomad List is the definitive platform for digital nomads. Remote OK is one of the largest remote job boards. Photo AI has achieved remarkable success in the competitive AI services market. Market leadership is characteristic of individuals at the very top of their fields.

- **Influence on Field Practices**: Mr. Levels has fundamentally influenced how technology entrepreneurship is practiced, particularly in the indie hacker community. His "build in public" methodology has been adopted by thousands of entrepreneurs. His solo founder practices have influenced how entrepreneurs approach business building. His technical approaches have been studied and emulated. This level of influence on field practices is characteristic of individuals at the very top of their fields.

- **Recognition by Field Leaders**: Mr. Levels is recognized by other leaders in technology entrepreneurship as one of the most successful and influential figures in the field. Expert letters from recognized authorities confirm his standing at the top of the field. Media coverage consistently positions him as a leading figure in technology entrepreneurship. This recognition by peers and experts is strong evidence of position at the very top of the field.

- **Comparative Standing**: When compared to other recognized figures in technology entrepreneurship, Mr. Levels stands out for his combination of commercial success (over $2.7 million annual revenue), technical achievement (building sophisticated platforms as a solo developer), methodological innovation (pioneering build in public and solo founder practices), and educational contribution (book, blog, mentorship). Few technology entrepreneurs have achieved comparable success across all of these dimensions.

**Field-Specific Considerations**: The field of technology entrepreneurship, particularly independent/indie entrepreneurship, is a critical and rapidly growing sector of the U.S. and global economy. The January 2025 Policy Alert (PA-2025-02) emphasizes the importance of critical and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and digital innovation—areas where Mr. Levels has demonstrated extraordinary ability. His expertise in rapid product development, AI integration, and sustainable business model creation addresses key priorities for U.S. technological leadership and economic growth.

**Totality of Evidence**: When the evidence is considered in totality, it clearly demonstrates that Mr. Levels has achieved extraordinary ability in his field and has risen to the very top of technology entrepreneurship, software development, and digital business innovation. The convergence of major media recognition, substantial commercial success, technical innovation, methodological influence, educational contribution, and expert validation provides compelling evidence that Mr. Levels is one of the small percentage who have achieved the highest levels of recognition and success in his field.

The final merits determination strongly supports approval of this O-1A petition. Mr. Levels has not merely met the minimum criteria but has demonstrated extraordinary ability through multiple forms of evidence that collectively establish his position at the very top of his field.
