The Petitioner affirms its role as a Direct Employer and accepts all legal and logistical responsibilities outlined in the regulations.

ABOUT THE BENEFICIARY:

1\. Professional Overview

Mr. Aaron James Finch is one of the most decorated international cricketers of the modern era. He served as captain of the Australian national team in both T20I and ODI formats and is widely regarded as one of the most explosive and consistent batters in white-ball cricket history. He holds the world record for the highest individual score in a T20 International (172), and previously held the same record with a knock of 156 — both performances that redefined the boundaries of short-format cricket. 

Over a 12-year international career, Mr. Finch played in 254 matches across all formats and amassed more than 8,800 runs, including 17 ODI centuries and 2 T20I centuries. He led Australia to its first-ever ICC Men’s T20 World Cup title in 2021, cementing his legacy as both a top-tier performer and an exceptional leader on the world stage.

2\. Extraordinary Ability in a Narrow Field

Mr. Finch’s sustained excellence is further evidenced by his selection to the ICC Men’s T20I Team of the Decade, multiple ICC “Performance of the Year” awards, and recognition as Australia’s T20I Player of the Year in both 2014 and 2018\. He has held the top position in the ICC T20I batting rankings and has served as a strategic influence in shaping the modern role of the aggressive opening batsman. His work has been profiled extensively in global sports media such as The Guardian, Sky Sports, The Cricket Monthly, ABC News, and Cricket.com.au.

3\. Contribution to the United States

Mr. Finch’s presence in the United States will significantly contribute to the development, visibility, and professionalization of cricket across North America. Through his direct engagement with Samp Army, Mr. Finch will participate in high-profile matches, youth development initiatives, media engagements, and talent mentorship programs. His experience and leadership will serve to elevate the competitive quality of U.S.-based cricket leagues and stimulate greater commercial and fan engagement with the sport nationwide.

ADVISORY OPINION / CONSULTATION LETTER

After conducting a thorough and good-faith effort to locate a relevant labor union, peer group, or professional association for professional cricketers in the United States, the Petitioner was unable to identify any such entity capable of providing a formal consultation letter as outlined under 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(2)(iii)(A). Cricket, while rapidly growing in the U.S., does not have a domestic governing body equivalent to a U.S.-recognized peer group for international player evaluations at this time.

In accordance with 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(2)(iii)(E), the Petitioner respectfully submits alternative evidence to meet the consultation requirement. This evidence includes:

\- Letters from internationally recognized cricket experts attesting to Mr. Finch’s extraordinary ability and impact on the sport globally;  
\- Extensive third-party documentation including press features, performance statistics, and league records confirming Mr. Finch’s status as an elite athlete;  
\- Supporting documentation from the Petitioner outlining the terms and scope of employment.

We respectfully request that USCIS accept this evidence in lieu of a traditional consultation letter, as permitted under the regulatory framework.

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

To qualify for O-1A classification, the Beneficiary must demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and recognition for achievements in the field of expertise. In accordance with 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3), eligibility may be demonstrated through either:

\- A major, internationally recognized award, or  
\- At least three (3) of the eight regulatory criteria outlined in 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)

Mr. Finch meets and exceeds the regulatory threshold, satisfying at least six (6) distinct criteria through robust documentation and independent third-party evidence, including:

1\. Receipt of internationally recognized awards for excellence in cricket;  
2\. Published material about the Beneficiary in major media and professional sports publications;  
3\. Participation in a critical role for organizations with distinguished reputations (including the Australian national team and ICC World Cup campaigns);  
4\. Original contributions of major significance to the field of international cricket;  
5\. Commanding a high salary as compared to others in the field;  
6\. Recognition as a leading athlete in official statistical databases and historical records of international cricket.

Each of these criteria is supported with primary evidence and corresponding exhibits.

EVIDENCE OF EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY

The Beneficiary does not claim qualification under a single major internationally recognized award (e.g., Nobel Prize equivalent) as outlined in 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iii), but instead qualifies through documented satisfaction of more than three (3) of the evidentiary criteria listed in 8 CFR § 214.2(o)(3)(iv). The evidence includes the following:  
---

## **Criterion 1: Documentation of the Beneficiary’s Receipt of Nationally or Internationally Recognized Prizes or Awards for Excellence**

###  **Summary of Satisfaction:**

Aaron Finch satisfies this criterion through multiple high-prestige, internationally recognized awards conferred by the **International Cricket Council (ICC)** and **Cricket Australia**, each of which are governing bodies at the highest level of global and national sport, respectively. These honors were awarded through **competitive peer-reviewed selection processes** and signify elite-level excellence within professional international cricket.

These honors are given by the ICC to only **one global cricketer annually**, based on **objective match data** and **expert panel review**. This is equivalent to “Player of the Year” awards in other international sports (e.g., FIFA, ATP, FIBA).

**Awarding Body:** Cricket Australia

---

### **Award 3: ICC Men’s T20I Team of the Decade (2011–2020)**

**Awarding Body:** International Cricket Council (ICC)  
**Date Announced:** December 2020

Mr. Finch was named to the official **T20I Team of the Decade**, a rare honor that reflects **global career-long excellence** and **peerless performance** in the shortest international format.
