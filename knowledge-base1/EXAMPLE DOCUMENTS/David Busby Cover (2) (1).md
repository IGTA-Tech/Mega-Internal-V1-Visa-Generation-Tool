IGTA is committed to ensuring full compliance  with all immigration regulations while coordinating the Beneficiary’s professional engagements  with distinguished employers, athletic organizations, and training institutions.  

**ABOUT THE BENEFICIARY**  

**1\. Professional Overview**  

The Beneficiary, **David Busby**, is a highly accomplished professional rugby athlete with over a  decade of elite-level experience. Born in Northern Ireland, Mr. Busby first emerged as a  standout player within the Ulster Rugby Academy, where he advanced to the senior Ulster  squad and competed at the highest levels of European rugby. He represented **Ireland at the  U20 level in the 2014 Six Nations Tournament**, and later contributed to the **Ireland Men’s  Sevens program in international competition.** 

Since 2020, Mr. Busby has played in the United States for the **Seattle Seawolves**, one of the  most competitive franchises in Major League Rugby (MLR). With the Seawolves, he has been  instrumental in securing multiple playoff appearances and a **Western Conference  Championship**. His versatility across the backline — excelling at wing, fullback, and center —  has made him a critical contributor to one of the league’s most distinguished organizations.  

**2\. Extraordinary Ability and International Recognition in Athletics**  Mr. Busby has demonstrated extraordinary ability in the field of rugby, as evidenced by:  

● **Sustained International Representation** – Competing for Ireland’s U20 National Team  and representing Ireland in international Sevens rugby competitions. 

● **Professional Success in Distinguished Leagues** – Playing for Ulster Rugby in the  PRO14 and the Seattle Seawolves in Major League Rugby, both recognized as premier  professional rugby environments. 

● **Letters of Support from Esteemed Experts** – Leading coaches, Olympians, and  international athletes have attested to his exceptional skill, leadership, and impact on the  sport. 

● **Media Recognition** – Coverage in respected rugby media and mainstream outlets,  including *Ultimate Rugby*, *RugbyPass*, and *Americas Rugby News*, highlighting his   
professional achievements and contributions to team success. 

● **Coaching & Mentorship Contributions** – In addition to playing, Mr. Busby has served  in coaching roles for youth and collegiate programs in the United States, contributing to  the growth of rugby in a developing market. 

**3\. Contribution to the United States**  

The Beneficiary’s continued presence in the U.S. will make significant contributions to the  development of American rugby at the professional, grassroots, and community levels. His  participation as a player, mentor, and coach strengthens domestic athletic programs, enhances  international competitiveness, and supports the broader U.S. rugby ecosystem as the nation  prepares to host the **2031 Men’s Rugby World Cup and the 2033 Women’s Rugby World  Cup**.  

**Advisory Opinion / Consultation Letter**  

Pursuant to **8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(2)(iii)(E)**, an advisory opinion (consultation letter) is ordinarily  required from a peer group, labor organization, or management organization in the field of  endeavor.  

In this case, the Petitioner has conducted an exhaustive search and determined that there is **no  appropriate labor organization or peer group** in the United States capable of issuing a  consultation letter for an international rugby professional such as Mr. Busby. While **USA Rugby** functions as the national governing body for rugby in the United States, it does not provide  individual advisory letters for professional athletes seeking nonimmigrant classification.  

To comply with the spirit and intent of the regulation, the Petitioner respectfully submits  **alternative evidence** of the Beneficiary’s extraordinary ability and recognition in the field. This  includes:  

● **Letters of Support from Experts** – Detailed testimonial letters from distinguished  coaches, executives, and athletes familiar with Mr. Busby’s career and his impact on  professional rugby. 

● **Documentary Evidence of Achievements** – Competition records, press articles, and  organizational materials establishing the Beneficiary’s standing as an athlete of  extraordinary ability. 

● **Official Roster Inclusions** – Documentation from Ulster Rugby, the Ireland U-20 and  Sevens teams, and the Seattle Seawolves confirming Busby’s selection and employment  in critical roles.  
**Conclusion:** The Petitioner respectfully requests that USCIS accept this alternative evidence in  place of a consultation letter, consistent with the regulations and prior agency practice in cases  where no labor organization exists to provide an opinion in the specific field.  

**Regulatory Framework**  

Pursuant to **8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iii)**, an O-1A petition must demonstrate that the Beneficiary  either:  

1\. Has received a **major, internationally recognized award** (such as the Nobel Prize); or 2\. Meets at least **three of the eight evidentiary criteria** listed in **8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)**. 

The regulation at **8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)** provides that, absent a singular award, the  Petitioner may establish eligibility by submitting evidence of at least three of the following:  

i. Documentation of the Beneficiary’s receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or  awards for excellence in the field of endeavor. 

 ii. Documentation of the Beneficiary’s membership in associations in the field for which  classification is sought, which require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by  recognized national or international experts. 

 iii. Published material in professional or major trade publications or major media about the  Beneficiary, relating to the Beneficiary’s work in the field, which must include the title, date, and  author of such material. 

 iv. Evidence of the Beneficiary’s participation, either individually or on a panel, as a judge of the  work of others in the same or an allied field. 

 v. Evidence of the Beneficiary’s original contributions of major significance in the field.  vi. Evidence of the Beneficiary’s authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional  journals or other major media. 

 vii. Evidence that the Beneficiary has been employed in a critical or essential capacity for  organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation. 

 viii. Evidence that the Beneficiary has commanded, or will command, a high salary or other  remuneration for services, as evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence.  

Additionally, under **8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v)**, where one or more of the foregoing criteria do not  readily apply, a Petitioner may submit **comparable evidence** to establish eligibility.  

**Criterion (i): Nationally or Internationally Recognized  Prizes or Awards**   
**Regulatory Standard:** 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)(A).  

**Application to Mr. Busby:** 

 Mr. Busby has been repeatedly selected to represent **Ireland in official international  competitions**, which constitutes receipt of internationally recognized awards. National team  selection is universally understood in athletics as a distinction of the highest order, conferred  only upon athletes judged to be among the very best by panels of experts.  

● **Ireland U-20 Six Nations Championship (2014):** 

○ Mr. Busby was selected to represent Ireland in the Six Nations U-20 tournament,  one of the most competitive youth international rugby competitions in the world. 

○ *Evidence:* Irish Independent match report confirming Busby in the U-20 squad  (Exhibit 21); Ulster Rugby announcement naming him in the official Ireland U-20  squad (Exhibit 35). 

● **Ireland Men’s Sevens Program (2016–2017):** 

○ Busby was again selected for the national sevens squad, competing in Rugby  Europe tournaments. This required an expert evaluation process and reflects  recognition at the senior international level. 

○ *Evidence:* IRFU/Ulster Rugby notices naming Busby in the Ireland Sevens  squads (Exhibits 26–27); KildareNow report on the 7s Grand Prix listing Busby  (Exhibit 23). 

**Conclusion:** Selection to represent Ireland in both the U-20 Six Nations and the national  Sevens program is direct evidence of nationally and internationally recognized awards for  excellence. **Accordingly, the Beneficiary has demonstrated nationally and internationally  recognized achievement in athletics, and the evidentiary record clearly establishes  satisfaction of Criterion (i).**  

**Criterion (ii): Membership in Associations Requiring  Outstanding Achievements**  

**Regulatory Standard:** 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)(B).  

**Application to Mr. Busby:** 

 In professional sports, **team and roster membership** in elite leagues and national programs  serves as membership in associations that require extraordinary achievements. Entry into these   
organizations is not open to the general public; it is restricted to individuals who have  demonstrated exceptional skill, evaluated by national or international experts.  

● **Ulster Rugby Senior Squad (Pro14):** 

○ Membership in Ulster Rugby’s senior squad is based on **expert coaching  selection**. Busby advanced from the academy into the senior squad,  

demonstrating that his achievements met the high threshold required for elite  professional rugby in Europe. 

○ *Evidence:* Ulster Rugby Academy and squad announcements (Exhibits 30 & 31,  pp. 241–247); match reports confirming his competitive appearances (Exhibits  11–12). 

● **Ireland National Teams (U-20 Six Nations & Men’s Sevens):** 

○ Both the U-20 Six Nations and the Ireland Sevens squads operate as official  associations, admitting only athletes deemed the **best of their generation**.  Selection is made by Ireland’s national selectors after rigorous evaluation. 

○ *Evidence:* IRFU/Ulster Rugby training squad and tournament announcements  (Exhibits 26–27, 35, pp. 215–219, 227–236, 267–269); third-party press such as  Irish Independent and KildareNow (Exhibits 21 & 23). 

● **Seattle Seawolves (MLR Champions):** 

○ As with Ulster, Seawolves roster membership represents selection into a  professional association reserved exclusively for top athletes, vetted by coaching  experts and managers. Busby has maintained his roster place across multiple  seasons, which itself is evidence of his sustained excellence. 

○ *Evidence:* Official Seawolves rosters (Exhibit 15, p. 101; Exhibit 62); Americas  Rugby News reports confirming Busby’s signing and re-signing (Exhibits 93 &  95). 

**Conclusion:** By virtue of his membership in **elite national teams and professional clubs**, Mr.  Busby has demonstrated extraordinary ability and recognition by expert evaluators. Such  memberships clearly satisfy the regulatory standard. **Criterion (ii) is satisfied.**  

**Criterion (iii): Published Material in Major Media**   
**Regulatory Standard:** 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)(C).  

**Application to Mr. Busby:** 

 Mr. Busby’s professional rugby achievements have been widely documented in reputable  international rugby media and general press. The published materials directly highlight his  accomplishments as an elite professional athlete.

○ *FOX 13 Seattle* interviews and “Rugby 101: Rules of Respect” segment featuring  Busby. 

● **Official Team Media (recognized by press as authoritative):**

**Conclusion:** These materials meet the regulation by (1) appearing in professional/major media,  (2) directly covering Busby’s achievements, and (3) providing the required bibliographic detail.  **Criterion (iii) is satisfied.**  

**Criterion (v): Original Contributions of Major Significance  Regulatory Standard: 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)(E).**  
Application to Mr. Busby: 

 In professional athletics, original contributions are often demonstrated through impact on team  success, development of the sport in new markets, and contributions to athlete training and  mentorship. Mr. Busby has made significant contributions of lasting importance in these  respects:  

● Professional Impact: Busby was instrumental in helping the Seattle Seawolves secure  playoff appearances and a Western Conference title. His versatility across backline  positions (wing, fullback, center) has allowed the Seawolves to maintain competitive  dominance, and his performance has been covered extensively in rugby media. 

● Youth Development & Mentorship: Beyond professional play, Busby has engaged in  coaching clinics and mentorship programs for youth and collegiate players in the United  States. This work directly contributes to the growth of rugby in America, a developing  market where professional players’ contributions are considered critical to national  expansion. 

● Growth of U.S. Rugby in Anticipation of the 2031 and 2033 Rugby World Cups: Busby’s  presence and profile in MLR are part of a broader movement to elevate rugby in the  United States. As an internationally experienced player, his contributions directly  advance the sport’s competitiveness in advance of major world events being hosted in  the U.S. 

Conclusion: These contributions demonstrate that Mr. Busby has made original, significant  contributions to the development and advancement of rugby, particularly within the United  States. Criterion (v) is satisfied.  

**Criterion (vii): Employment in a Critical or Essential Role  for Distinguished Organizations**  

**Regulatory Standard:** 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)(VII).  

**Application to Mr. Busby:** 

 Mr. Busby has repeatedly been employed in **critical roles for organizations of distinguished  international reputation**. His inclusion in these teams is itself recognition of his extraordinary  ability, as each organization maintains high selection standards and competes at the top levels  of the sport.  

● **Ulster Rugby (2015–2019):**  
○ Ulster Rugby is one of the four historic Irish provincial teams, competing in  Europe’s **Pro14** league and European Cup tournaments. These leagues  represent the highest standard of professional rugby in Europe. 

○ Busby made his senior debut for Ulster in February 2017, scoring a try on debut.  His continued selection placed him among the top echelon of European rugby  professionals. 

○ *Evidence:* ESPN and Sky Sports match reports noting Busby’s try-scoring debut  against Zebre (Exhibits 11–12); HelloRayo article “Hat-Trick of Wins for Ulster,”  highlighting his first senior appearance and try (Exhibit 29). 

● **Ireland National Teams (U-20 and Sevens):** 

○ Representing one’s country is the clearest evidence of employment in a critical  role. Busby was entrusted to represent Ireland at the U-20 Six Nations and the  Sevens program — both highly selective and internationally distinguished. 

○ *Evidence:* IRFU/Ulster Rugby squad announcements (Exhibits 26–27); Irish  Independent and KildareNow reports naming Busby in national squads (Exhibits  21 & 23). 

● **Seattle Seawolves (2020–Present):** 

○ The Seawolves are a multiple-time **Major League Rugby (MLR) champions**,  widely regarded as one of the league’s flagship franchises. 

○ Busby has been a central contributor since joining in 2020, helping secure  **Western Conference Championships** and multiple playoff appearances. He  has been entrusted in versatile roles across the backline — wing, fullback, and  center — underscoring his critical importance. 

○ *Evidence:* Seattle Seawolves official roster & bio (Exhibit 15); MLR match  previews and recaps naming Busby in lineups. 

**Conclusion:** Mr. Busby has consistently been placed in **essential positions** for organizations  with undisputed international reputations, including Ulster Rugby, Ireland’s national teams, and  the Seattle Seawolves. His career trajectory demonstrates that he is not merely a participant but  a relied-upon performer. **Criterion (vii) is satisfied.**   
**Criterion (viii): High Salary or Comparable Evidence of Remuneration**  

**Regulatory Standard: 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(iv)(H).** 

Application to Mr. Busby: 

 While Major League Rugby maintains salary caps that may limit conventional “high salary”  comparisons, comparable evidence under 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(o)(3)(v) is appropriate.  

● Professional Contracts: Mr. Busby’s employment contracts with the Seattle Seawolves  confirm compensation consistent with international professional athletes, above the  averages for domestic U.S. players. 

● Market Valuation: Independent rugby sources list Busby’s market valuation and  professional standing, reflecting the fact that international-caliber players like Busby are  recruited specifically because of their exceptional quality and command higher  remuneration than local peers. 

● Comparable Evidence: In rugby, remuneration is not only financial but also demonstrated  through selection to professional contracts abroad, full sponsorship of travel/visas, and  continuing re-signings by premier franchises. Each of these elements underscores his  elevated standing. 

Conclusion: Even accounting for league salary caps, the evidence establishes that Busby  commands compensation and contractual benefits above domestic peers, satisfying this  criterion through comparable evidence. Criterion (viii) is satisfied.
