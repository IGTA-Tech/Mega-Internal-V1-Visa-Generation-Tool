To establish eligibility, the Beneficiary may qualify by:

* Receiving a **major internationally recognized award** (such as an Olympic medal), or

* Providing evidence that satisfies **at least three (3) of the eight (8)** evidentiary categories outlined by USCIS.

While Mr. Tolu’s **Olympic participation and Asian continental record** are highly probative on their own, this petition includes **extensive documentation under five (5) regulatory criteria**, including:

3. **Published material in major media about the Beneficiary’s work in the field**
