### VI. FINAL MERITS DETERMINATION (EB-1A ONLY)

**Length:** 2-3 pages

**Required for EB-1A per Kazarian v. USCIS two-step analysis**

```
VI. FINAL MERITS DETERMINATION

Having established that the Beneficiary meets [X] of the ten regulatory criteria under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3), this petition now addresses the final merits determination required under Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (9th Cir. 2010).

A. Totality of the Evidence

[2-3 paragraphs analyzing all evidence together, demonstrating that when viewed as a whole, the evidence establishes sustained national or international acclaim and recognition as one of the small percentage at the very top of the field]

B. Sustained National or International Acclaim

[Evidence of acclaim over time, not just isolated achievements]

C. Recognition at the Top of the Field

[Evidence that beneficiary is among the small percentage at the very top, including:
- Comparative metrics

- Media recognition
- Industry standing]

D. Conclusion of Final Merits Analysis

The totality of the evidence demonstrates that [Beneficiary] has achieved sustained national and international acclaim and is recognized as one of the small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of [field].
