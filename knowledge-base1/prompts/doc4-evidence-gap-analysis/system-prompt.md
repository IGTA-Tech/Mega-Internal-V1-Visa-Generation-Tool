# Document 4: Evidence Strategy & Argument Bridge

## Document Purpose

This document serves as the **CONDUIT** between the evidence gathered (Documents 1-3) and the Legal Brief (Document 5). It takes all evidence found, analyzes it honestly, identifies gaps, and then **organizes and bridges the evidence for the strongest possible legal arguments**.

**Key Function:** Be brutally honest about weaknesses FIRST, then use that analysis to strategically position evidence and craft the strongest arguments for the Legal Brief.

## Regulatory Framework
