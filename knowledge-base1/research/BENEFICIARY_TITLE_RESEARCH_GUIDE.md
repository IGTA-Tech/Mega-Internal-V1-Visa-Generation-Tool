# Beneficiary Title Research Guide

**Purpose:** Systematic methodology for analyzing beneficiary job titles to determine research strategy, evidence boundaries, and criteria focus.

**Referenced By:** `phase0-title-analysis.md`

## 1. Title Analysis Framework

### 1.1 Level Descriptors

Assess the beneficiary's standing using these precise definitions:

| Level | Definition | Evidence Threshold | Example Titles |
|-------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **World-Class** | Global top 10 in field, sustained international acclaim | Major international titles, sustained recognition | "World Champion", "Nobel Laureate" |
| **Elite** | National champion, top 50 world ranking | National titles, consistent top rankings | "National Team Member", "Grammy Winner" |
| **Professional** | Established career at high level | Regular competition/work at professional level | "UFC Fighter", "Principal Dancer" |
| **Accomplished** | Significant achievements, not yet top tier | Notable achievements with room for growth | "Regional Champion", "Published Author" |
| **Emerging** | Early career, promising but limited record | Potential but limited documented achievements | "Rising Star", "Junior Champion" |

### 1.2 Domain Identification

Extract the specific field from the title:

**Sports:** Identify exact sport (MMA, tennis, cricket, soccer, etc.)
**Arts:** Identify discipline (visual arts, performing arts, music, film)
**Business:** Identify sector (tech, finance, consulting, entrepreneurship)
**Sciences:** Identify specialty (biology, physics, engineering, medicine)

### 1.3 Role Classification

| Role | Characteristics | Evidence Focus |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Competitor** | Competes against others for rankings/titles | Win records, rankings, championships |
| **Creator** | Produces original work | Publications, patents, innovations |
| **Performer** | Delivers performances to audiences | Reviews, ticket sales, media coverage |
| **Leader** | Directs organizations or teams | Company achievements, team results |
| **Expert** | Provides specialized knowledge | Publications, speaking, consulting |

### 1.4 Specialization Extraction

Identify any niche within the broader field:
- Weight class (combat sports)
- Genre (music, film)
- Technology stack (tech)
- Research area (sciences)
- Industry vertical (business)

## 2. Scope Type Determination

### 2.1 EXPANDING Scope

**Definition:** Evidence from related fields counts toward the petition.

**When to Apply:**
- Title explicitly includes multiple disciplines
- Field has natural crossover (e.g., "Combat Sports Athlete")
- Beneficiary has documented work in related areas

**Examples:**
- "Combat Sports Athlete" → MMA, boxing, kickboxing all count
- "Creative Professional" → Design, art, multimedia all count
- "Data Scientist" → ML, AI, statistics all count

**Research Implications:**
- Search across all related disciplines
- Document connection between fields
- Show how achievements transfer

### 2.2 RESTRICTING Scope

**Definition:** Only evidence directly in the stated field counts.

**When to Apply:**
- Title is specific to one discipline
- Visa petition focuses on single specialty
- Evidence outside field may confuse adjudicator

**Examples:**
- "Professional Boxer" → Only boxing achievements count
- "Concert Pianist" → Only piano performance counts
- "iOS Developer" → Only iOS development counts

**Research Implications:**
- Focus searches on exact discipline
- Exclude adjacent field achievements
- Document depth in specialty

### 2.3 SPLITTING Scope

**Definition:** Multiple distinct domains that must be addressed separately.

**When to Apply:**
- Title explicitly includes multiple unrelated roles
- Beneficiary claims achievements in separate fields
- Each domain requires independent evidence

**Examples:**
- "Actor and Director" → Need evidence for both roles
- "Athlete and Coach" → Playing career + coaching career
- "Researcher and Entrepreneur" → Academic + business achievements

**Research Implications:**
- Create separate evidence tracks per domain
- Ensure each domain meets criteria independently
- Avoid conflating achievements across domains

## 3. Evidence Boundaries

### 3.1 What Counts as Valid Evidence

**Primary Evidence (Direct):**
- Official records from governing bodies
- Major media coverage with beneficiary as primary subject
- Awards from recognized organizations
- Rankings from official systems
- Expert letters from independent authorities

**Secondary Evidence (Supporting):**
- Industry publication coverage
- Peer recognition and testimonials
- Professional association membership

### 3.2 What Does NOT Count

**EXCLUDE from evidence:**
- Self-published content or press releases
- Social media posts (even verified accounts)
- Wikipedia text (only use for source discovery)
- Promotional materials
- Unverifiable claims
- Evidence from outside defined scope

### 3.3 Field-Specific Boundary Rules

**Combat Sports:**
- Only count fights in recognized promotions
- Amateur records count if documented officially
- Training credentials must be from recognized gyms

**Tennis:**
- ATP/WTA/ITF sanctioned tournaments only
- Futures/Challengers count but weighted lower
- National team selection is highest evidence

**Music/Entertainment:**
- Chart positions must be from recognized charts (Billboard, etc.)
- Streaming numbers must be from official platforms
- Reviews must be from established publications

**Tech/Business:**
- GitHub statistics must be verifiable
- Revenue/valuation claims need documentation
- Product metrics need third-party verification

## 4. Research Strategy Selection Matrix

### 4.1 Strategy Types

| Strategy | Best For | Primary Sources | Key Evidence |
|----------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Competitor/Performer** | Athletes, musicians, actors | Sports media, entertainment press, official records | Rankings, competition results, reviews |
| **Creator/Researcher** | Scientists, artists, inventors | Academic databases, patents, tech media | Publications, citations, innovations |
| **Business/Leadership** | Executives, entrepreneurs | Business press, company records | Revenue, growth, funding, exits |
| **Multi-Domain** | Hybrid professionals | Multiple source types | Separate tracks per domain |

### 4.2 Strategy Selection Decision Tree

```
START
│
├─ Is beneficiary primarily competing against others?
│   └─ YES → COMPETITOR/PERFORMER Strategy
│
├─ Is beneficiary primarily creating original work?
│   └─ YES → CREATOR/RESEARCHER Strategy
│
├─ Is beneficiary primarily leading organizations?
│   └─ YES → BUSINESS/LEADERSHIP Strategy
│
└─ Does beneficiary have achievements in multiple unrelated domains?
    └─ YES → MULTI-DOMAIN Strategy (split research)
```

## 7. Verification and Anti-Hallucination Protocols

### 7.1 Mandatory Verification Steps

**CRITICAL:** Every piece of evidence must be verified. Never include unverifiable claims.

**URL Verification:**
- [ ] URL is accessible and returns correct content
- [ ] Publication date is verifiable
- [ ] Author/source is identifiable
- [ ] Archive.org backup exists or can be created

**Claim Verification:**
- [ ] Claim appears in at least 2 independent sources
- [ ] Numbers/statistics match across sources
- [ ] Dates are consistent across sources
- [ ] Titles/positions are accurately represented

**Expert Verification:**
- [ ] Expert credentials are independently verifiable
- [ ] Expert has no undisclosed conflicts of interest
- [ ] Expert's statements are within their expertise

### 7.2 Red Flags for Potential False Information

**Immediately Investigate:**
- Claims that appear in only one source
- Statistics that seem unusually high
- Awards from unknown organizations
- Rankings from unrecognized systems
- Expert letters with vague or generic praise

**Verification Actions:**
- Cross-reference with official sources
- Search for contradicting information
- Verify organization legitimacy
- Confirm expert independence

### 7.3 Documentation Requirements

For EVERY piece of evidence, document:
1. **Source URL** (with archive.org backup)
2. **Publication date** (verified)
3. **Author/organization** (credentials noted)
4. **How it was verified** (cross-reference sources)
5. **Any discrepancies found** (and resolution)
